=======================================

Inspired rankings.ini files, this .ini file is my personal ranking of the arcade games that MAME; to create the file is examined the whole set, but excluding:

* BIOS
* Casino
* Clones
* Devices
* Home Systems (including consoles and all computers)
* Mahjong
* Mechanical
* Medal Game
* Not Working

The list of supported games is generated by this research: http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/?search=mame&clone=0&tipo_gioco=parent&driver_status=workingimperfect
Remember that it is personal assessments, which are affected by many factors. These are not general acceptance charts.
If there are marks that you feel obviously wrong, send me a message on MAMEWorld forum indicating the name of the game (according to the MAME description)
and the vote that you would like him to be assigned. I will consider all your e-mails.
