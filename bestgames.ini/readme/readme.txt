=======================================

Inspired rankings.ini files, this .ini file is my personal ranking of the arcade games that MAME; to create the file is examined the whole set, but excluding:

* Clones
* BIOS
* Devices
* Mechanical
* Medal Game
* Not Working
* Casino
* Mahjong
* Home Systems

The list of supported games is generated by this research: http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/?search=mame&clone=0&tipo_gioco=parent&driver_status=workingimperfect
Remember that it is personal assessments, which are affected by many factors. These are not general acceptance charts.
If there are marks that you feel obviously wrong, send me a message on MAMEWorld forum indicating the name of the game (according to the MAME description)
and the vote that you would like him to be assigned. I will consider all your mails.
