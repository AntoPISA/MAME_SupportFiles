$mame
TIPS:

To save a tape: SAVE

To load a tape: LOAD

Demo programs for the 990189v: You can get impressive colour displays (with sprites) from the 4 included demos. Press the Enter key after each instruction, and wait for the READY prompt before proceeding to the next.

NEW
LOADx (where x = 0,1,2,3)
RUN

University BASIC fully supports the tms9918 videocard option. For example, enter COLOR x (where x = 1 to 15), to get a coloured background.

Bug - The input buffer of character segments isn't fully cleared. If you press Shift, then Z enough times, garbage appears. This is because the boot process should have set 18C-1CB to FF, but only sets up to 1B3.

TIPS:

ATARI 2600 (VCS)

TIPS:

* Notes:
* - Hold DEL down during boot reset the CMOS memory to the default values.
* - default NVRAM is plainly wrong. Use the status/configure commands to set up properly
*   (Scroll Lock is currently mapped with Right SHIFT, use this to move to next page of status).
*   In order to load a floppy, you need at very least:
*   - configure floppies 1
*   - configure filesystem adfs
*   - configure monitortype 12
*   Then reboot / reset the machine, and use cat to (attempt) to list a floppy's contents.

-   (modify) Memory display and modification    l   (load) Reads a block of bytes from tape
X   (go) Run program starting at an address     r   (return) Resume after a breakpoint
p   (point) Inserts or removes breakpoint       (up) Increment displayed address

Test Paste:
-0100^11^22^33^44^55^66^77^88^99^-0100^
Now press up-arrow to confirm the data has been entered.


Example usage: Turn on. Press -. Mode letter will show 'A'. Type in an address (example FE00). Press - (or any command key). Contents will show on the right. Use Up & Down keys to cycle through addresses.

To save a tape, press S then enter start address, press S, enter end address+1, start recording and press S. The save only takes a few seconds.

To load a tape, the display must just have dots, (reset if necessary), start playing tape and immediately press L. The last digit will flicker as the bytes load. At the end, the dots will show again. There's no error checking, so if it doesn't work, reset and try again.

Note that left-most digit is not wired up, and therefore will always be blank.

TIPS:

Cassette considerations:

- It operates at 4883 baud but may not be fully compatible with real hardware. A partial translation of the available text seems to indicate an overcomplicated and unreliable interface. The one implemented is 100% reliable at the same speed. Unable to locate any real recordings to compare against.
- To save a range of memory: S name start end
- To load it back: L name
- To save an unnamed file: S "" start end
- To load an unnamed file: L
- When loading, if the name doesn't match, there's no message, and no way to determine the name.
- For some reason, the system saves the file 3 times. Maybe it was an attempt to guard against the inherent unreliable design.

=======================

The monitor
-----------
From Basic, do CALL 28672 to enter the monitor - you get a * prompt. Commands:
D nnnn  - display memory
G nnnn  - goto an address
M nnnn  - modify memory
Type the command letter, then all 4 digits, no need to hit Enter.
To exit back to Basic, do G 8894 (Basic has no prompt).

Tapes can only be processed through BASIC. So, load the basic cart from the software list, and then load the tape.

CLOAD     to load the tape
CSAVE     to save.

A tape can only be successfully loaded if the machine it was recorded on has the same amount of RAM as the destination machine.

Even then, tape loading is unreliable and there's no error if things go wrong.

To load and run a tape:
Some programs run from the monitor prompt, while Basic programs must be loaded in the monitor and run from Basic.

Monitor programs:
1. Type C100R, press <Enter>. This gives the prompt A9*.
2. Now enter the load instructions as per the usage, e.g E000.EFFFR but don't press <Enter> yet.
3. Start the tape via the Tab menu Tape Control (NOT by pressing F2), wait for the leader tone then press <Enter>.
4. When it's finished you are back to the \ prompt.
5. Enter the "enter at" information, press <Return> to run the program.

Basic programs:
1. You must already have loaded and run Basic (use basica from the software list). Do a soft reset (Scroll-Lock then F3) to get back to the monitor.
2. Now enter the load instructions as per the usage, e.g 4A.00FFR300.FFFR but don't press <Enter> yet.
3. Start the tape via the Tab menu Tape Control (NOT by pressing F2), wait for the leader tone then press <Enter>.
4. When it's finished you are back to the \ prompt.
5. Go back to Basic by typing E2B3R <Enter>
6. Now you can LIST or RUN the program.

To save a tape, you need to be in the monitor.

TIPS:

For the game to work properly, you need to calibrate ALL 3 guns! If you try to do only one, as the manual states, the eprom has invalid gun data and the screen go black after rebooting. Fire at indicated spots with P1, P2 and P3 controls. Only then will a proper eprom be made.

TIPS:

At start, hit enter to allow Basic to start correctly.

LOAD - load a Basic program from tape
SAVE - save a Basic program to tape

It doesn't work though.

Don't try these commands on 'bcs3' - the emulated computer will crash.

Cassette
- is hooked up according to the documentation, but doesn't work.
- on the real machine it overrides the video output, so the video will be lost during cassette operations.
- does not exist on "bcs3". The commands SAVE and LOAD will attempt to use a non-existing rom at 0800, and crash the system.
- When you start any cassette-based system it asks for the number of lines you'd like on the screen, or hit enter for the default. Depending on the number, the BASIC program starts in a different place. So, to LOAD a tape, you must know the same number of lines that the program was SAVED at.
- Recordings are not compatible between the versions of BASIC.

Bugs:
- Tell it to PRINT ! (or any character it doesn't understand) and the screen fills up with zeroes. String are enclosed in single quotes. Double quotes will cause this bug.
- Undefined strings print as 0 instead of nothing.

TIPS:

Clone of the Terak 8510/a.

BK0010-01 is marked as working, but like all its clones, it has issues.

Computer starts in the Monitor (commands unknown), except BK0010-01 which starts in Vilnius Basic.

For BK0010-01, in Basic, LOAD"x" to load the tape, and SAVE"x" to save it. Filenames are always Case Sensitive.

BK0010FD - floppy disk version. Unknown how to interact with a floppy. BKD images are supposed to be supported but are rejected.

BK0011 (not emulated), BK0011M not working at all.

BK0010 monitor commands are not known.

BK0010-01 and BK0010FD can sometimes load games from the software list via the monitor.
If in Basic, enter MO to enter the monitor. Then M. You will be asked for the name - enter it (case sensitive). If you got it wrong the correct name will be displayed and the file skipped. If it was correct there is no acknowledgement, but the file loads. At the end, the game might start itself, or you might have to enter S. Due to bad emulation the computer will probably freeze at this point.

One known working game is Tetris.

- If you want to change the "Handicap" (High Score) setting, you may have to wipe the NVRAM before it will take.

La Rana is not a pinball machine - it looks like an upright arcade game with a frog's mouth and some holes on a lower panel, while some indicators are on the upper panel. The main scores are on the marquee. Each of 4 players has 3 digits. There's other buttons on the marquee too. The game has no screen.
It can be played by pressing 5 (insert coin), press 1 (start) for each player, press A (start timer), press various keys to score. Don't press X or the game instantly ends. When the timer runs out it switches to the next player, or ends.

INITIALIZATION:

CHIP-8 computer.

The display only updates after each 4 digits is entered, and you can't see what you type as you change bytes. This is by design.

The cassette has no checksum, header or blocks. It is simply a stream of pulses. The successful loading of a tape is therefore a matter of luck.

To modify memory, press RST, then enter the 4-digit address (nothing happens until the 4th digit is pressed), then press FN, then 0, then the 2 digit data. It will enter the data (you won't see anything), then the address will increment. Enter the data for this new address. If you want to skip this address, press FN. When you're done, press RST. NOTE!!! Do NOT change any of these addresses:
0000,0001,0006-007F, or the system may crash. It's recommended to start all your programs at 0200.

Function keys:
FN 0 - Modify memory - see above paragraph.

FN 1 - Tape load. You must have entered the start address at 0002, and the end address+1 at 0004 (big-endian).

FN 2 - Tape save. You must have entered the start address at 0002, and the end address+1 at 0004 (big-endian).

FN 3 - Run. To use, press RST, then enter the 4-digit start address (nothing happens until the 4th digit is pressed), then FN, then 3.

All CHIP-8 programs load at 0200 (max size 4k), and exec address is C000.

UP - (NXT) to enter data and advance to the next address
MINUS - (ADR) to change the address to what is shown in the data side
Special keys:
Hold UP, hold 0, release UP, release 0 - execute program at the current address (i.e. 2xx)
Hold UP, hold 1, release UP, release 1 - execute program at address 0C00 (rom MONA)
Hold UP, hold 2, release UP, release 2 - play a tune with the keys
Hold UP, hold 3, release UP, release 3 - decrement the address by 2
Hold MINUS, hold any hex key, release MINUS, release other key - execute program at the current address-0x100 (i.e. 1xx).

If you want to scan through other areas of memory (e.g. the roms), alter the data at address 2F9 (high byte) and 2FA (low byte).

How to Use:
The red digits are the address, and the orange digits are the data. The address range is 200-2FF (the 2 isn't displayed). To select an address, either press the UP key until you get there, or type the address and press minus. The orange digits show the current data at that address. To alter data, just type it in and press UP.

To play the reflexes game, hold UP, press 1, release UP, release 1. The display will show A--0 (or some random number in the last position). Press any odd-numbered key (B is convenient), and read off the reaction time. After a short delay it will show '--' again, this is the signal to react. It doesn't seem to reset the counters each time around.

TIPS:

Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key [ ~ ] and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

The Select key (Z) and the joystick don't actually exist, but they have been left in the keyboard matrix for now.


Quickloads
----------
You can load pgm and tvc files with the quickload facility. The quickloads are meant for the ElektorTVGC, however with a bit a trickery they can be made to work on the vc4000 as well. Procedure:

- Get a copy of the Elektor bios and rename it to ELEKTOR.BIN then save it with the rest of your vc4000 carts.

- Start vc4000, and load ELEKTOR.BIN into the cartslot. Now your vc4000 thinks it is an Elektor.

- Load a quickload file. Some of them will work, and in some cases, better than on the Elektor system.

If it isn't, adjust the settings, then restart the system.

Once started, press Space. The system will start up. All input must be in UPPERcase.

To save a tape: Ra,b,c (where a = start address, b = end address, c = program number)

To load a tape: Lc     (where c = program number)

For test purposes, program number of 1 works fine.

Microsoft Basic is executed entering the following 2 commands in the monitor prompt:
.XS nnnn-F87F mmmm-C000 <CR>
.G <CR>

where nnnn is the previous value of the stack pointer, and mmmm is the previous value of the program counter. The system will fill in these values for you. All you need to do is enter F87F, space, C000 when prompted, then hit Enter.

BASIC will request the amount of RAM memory available, 8192 (bytes) must be entered.
You can't quit from Basic back to the monitor.

INITIALIZATION:

First time:
- The default settings are fine, so start with a clean slate
- Wait for it to say No Ball, then hold down X.
- Keep holding X, insert credits, and press start. When it says ball 1, let go immediately.
- If you hold down X longer than you should, it says Coil Error, and the game is ended. You
should let go the instant the ball number increments.

Setting up:
The manual is not that clear, there's a lot we don't know, this *seems* to work...
- Start machine, wait for it to say No Ball, and it may play a tune
- Press num-1 (to simulate opening the front door)
- Press 1, it says BooP (Bookkeeping)
- Press num-1 and the credits number increments to 8, then 01 and on to 17 (2 pushes per number)
- When it gets to 01, the display says Adjust
- To adjust a setting, press 1 to choose a digit, then tap 9 until it is correct.
- The settings in the manual do not fully line up with what we see in the display.

Small FAQ:
- If game shows "Test" just after start, try cleaning the nvram etc. If it still does it, when
the red screen shows, hold down num-1 until "No Ball" starts flashing, then release the key.
- Game says "No Ball". Press and hold X.
- Game says "Coil Error". You held down X too long.

Status:
- flashman, fldragon, ironball, kz26, nautilus, phntmshp, ridersrf, rock2500, starfirp, theraid,
trailer, terrlake: playable
- sklflite: can insert coin, cannot start game
- spain82: see notes below
- megaaton: playable, ball number doesn't show. If it says Test, see FAQ above.
- ufo_x: playable. Make sure to release X after the last ball ends, or you get "Coil Error".
If you can't seem to score any points, hit minus to kick it into gear.

ToDo:
- Sometimes the machine starts up in a non-responsive state. Exit and restart.
- Skill Flight: not working
- Miss Disco: not working (no manual available). Uses different hardware. No sound rom.
- Spain82: can start a game but it's not really playable (no manual available).
The test buttons are unknown. The ball number doesn't show.
So, after starting the machine, make sure the displays cycle between blank and 700000. If it
just sits there it has hung up, exit and restart. Insert a coin, hold X and press 1. Now,
you need to jiggle F and G and perhaps other nearby keys until the 0 starts flashing. You
can then score. At outhole time, need to press F,G,X to register the fact. If you hit X too
many times the machine reboots itself. The machine has 2 capture holes and therefore multiball.
At ball 2, the playfield becomes unresponsive.
- Meg Aaton: Ball number doesn't show. Can suddenly reboot in the middle of a game. Match digits are reversed.

MAME only accepts 341/682KB D77 disks.

To access floppies: FILES "0:" for A drive, "1:" for B drive etc.
RUN "(drive)file"

Notes for FM77AV:
- FM7 floppies seem to run, or at least start up.
- None of the FM77AV-specific floppies can be used.

Cassettes
---------
To save a tape: SAVE"x"

If Basic, LOAD then RUN

If M/L, LOADM"",,R  (LOADM followed by EXEC may work)

You have to guess which one; Bad File Mode indicates it's wrong.

The system is intolerant of imperfections, the load will be terminated by I/O Error.

Not many tapes are accepted, and then only a few of those work.

May need to use LOADM"CAS0:(file)", LOAD"CAS0:(file)" .
If no disks, can RUN"(CAS0:)" .

- To load a tape: LOAD"CAS0:(F)FILENAME.BAS"[,R]
- To save a binary file: SAVEM"CAS0:(F)BINARY", start-address, end-address, go-address
- To load a binary file: LOADM"CAS0:(F)BINARY"[,R]
- Turn motor on/off: MOTOR ON or MOTOR OFF

where the option ,R parameter makes it run upon completion of loading, and (F) means 1200 baud, or (S) for 300 baud. The parenthises are required. If this parameter is omitted, then the speed is determined by the relevant dipswitch.

$info=harddriv
$mame
INITIALIZATION:

If you are having trouble controlling vehicle or the brake is always on, calibration must be done!
First off, Delete any .NV (NVRAM) file for this game contained in your NVRAM directory, called harddriv.nv or racedriv.nv or the same as the setname you intend to use. You need to understand how the controls are mapped in MAME. It's not very intuitive, so pay attention:

Steering Wheel: Player 1 Paddle control, by default maps to the mouse and the [ Left/Right Arrow ] keys.
Gas Pedal: Pedal 1 control, by default maps to the [ Left Control ] key. Pressing the key will quickly depress the analog control; releasing the key will release it.
Brake Pedal: Pedal 2 control, by default maps to the [ Left Alt ] key. Operates the same way as the gas pedal.
Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.
Key: Maps to Player 1 start button (default: [ 1 ] key).
Abort: Maps to Player 2 start button (default: [ 2 ] key).

Finally, here is a step-by-step tour through the calibration process. Note that even if you have an analog control connected to any of the analog controls in the game, it is much easier to do calibration with the keyboard.
* Take your hands and feet off all controls then turn key. Make absolutely sure you haven't touched any of the controls up to this point, then press the [ 1 ] key.
* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

TIPS:

Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

HOMELAB

Cassette
--------
To save a tape: SAVE"x"

To load a tape: LOAD

The cassette system is not working.


Quickload
---------
The filename should contain the information on how to start the game - often CALL $5000 .

If there's no info, look at the popup to get the start address, and add it to the filename.

Most files load at 0x4016, which indicates it is a Basic program, however it causes the machine to reboot. This is because they should be loaded as a cassette rather than a quickload, but that facility is lacking.

Homelab2 doesn't support hex numbers - use the equivalent decimal instead.

From swlist:

The computer is marked as not working, so to load a disk you need to tap B slowly until the cursor appears.
After the disk boots, entering rubbish can lock up the machine. The keyboard is somewhat unusual.
To backspace, press F9. The shift key doesn't work, so to shift, hit capslock, hit the shifted key, then capslock to go back to normal.

ROBOTRON HC900, KC85-2
======================

For some reason KCC images are assigned to both cassette and quickload.

SSS images, although supposedly supported, are all rejected and unusable.

Games generally only work on one of the computers, so they will be suffixed with [2],[3],[4].

A menu item can be selected either by typing its name, or by moving the cursor to the selection and hitting Enter.


Cartridge
---------
The only cartridge that works is "typestar". The rest are ignored.



Quickload
---------
The program may start itself, or may add extra names to the menu. Just enter the name of the most appropriate one.

If it does neither, then it's assumed to not work.



Cassette
--------
In the menu:
- To save a tape: SAVE a b (where a = start address, b = end address). You will be asked for a filename.
- To load a tape: LOAD  (when complete it should run itself)

It's presumed the JUMP command could be used to go to an address, but it always returns ERROR, so the jump needs to be done in the debugger.

In Basic:
- To save a tape: CSAVE "x"
- To load a tape: CLOAD "x"

Image types tested to work are KCC and TAP.

There's numerous bugs in the rom's keyboard routine. Shift has to be pressed and released before the key you want to shift. Lowercase cannot be input. The Ctrl key doesn't work. The . , / keys are incorrectly already shifted.

Even though cassette and terminal support are supposed to exist, the device redirection commands do nothing.

The natural keyboard has been added, although shifted characters will not work, or for paste either, because of the shift-key bug. Further, paste drops every second character.

Handy addresses: (Press X then the 4 digits then Enter)
0800 = BASIC cold start
0803 = BASIC warm start
13BE = display Monitor logo
This machine has an 8-digit LED display with hex keyboard, and also a 64x16 monochrome screen with full keyboard.
The monitor uses the hex keyboard, while Basic uses the full keyboard.
Monitor output is on the digits, but the single-step command displays a running register dump on the main screen.
There are no storage facilities, and no sound.
BASIC is integer only (-32768 to 32767), about 6k of space, and all input is to be in uppercase. It does have minimal string capability, but there is no $ sign, so how to create a string variable is unknown.
To exit back to the monitor, type BYE.
The user instructions of the monitor (in German) are here:

TIPS:

The BEL character plays a short tune.
In the monitor, it is case sensitive, most commands are uppercase, but some are lowercase.
To start Basic, the command is b. To quit basic, use BYE.
Inside Basic, it is not case-sensitive.

In the monitor:
- To save a tape in native format: K a b ["name"]
- To load native tape: L ["name"]
- To save a tape in ac1 format: S a b
- To load ac1 tape: Q
(where a = start address, b = end address, and name is optional)

To load a tape: If you don't know the name, do LOAD"", and the name will be displayed. Then do LOAD"name" .

Notes:
- The screen doesn't scroll. This is normal.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- Break key is the Escape key.
- Typing a line number doesn't delete the line, you are in a calculator mode (for example, typing 67-5 will print 62)
- DEL line-number deletes the line.
- To edit a line, press Ctrl-E, it asks for line number, type it in, then arrows to move left-right, backspace to delete, press keys to insert them
- If you entered a line and got a syntax error, press Ctrl-Q to edit it.
- Cassette tapes made on 128k are a different speed to 48k tapes. To load a 128k tape on a 48k system, enter TAPE 3 before loading. (2,3,4,5 all seem to work).
- When loading, there's no wildcard; you must specify the name.
- Info about disks:
- You must firstly do XROM to initialise the DOS ROM.

TIPS:

The volume for this game is TOO LOW!


When the game is running, hit [ F2 ] to get to the internal service menu. Hit [ F2 ] again to "close" the service switch so that you won't get stuck in the menu. Now, navigate to the "Volume Adjust" option (following the directions provided) and adjust the volume. It's best to keep the volume no more than 80-90% filled as it might cause your sound to be overdriven and crackle. When adjusted, simply exit the menu.

$info=mmd1
$mame
INITIALIZATION:

It appears that you enter an 3 digit octal number and then hit a function key.
H - puts the number in the H register
L - puts the number in the L register
S - puts the number into memory pointed to by HL and then increments HL.
G - Loads the program counter with the contents of HL

1) There is a 'working byte' which you can enter using the octal digits (just press them in order), and which is displayed on the port 2 LEDs when KEX is running.

2) 'R' is a hardware reset

3) 'H' and 'L' are used to load the address (high and low parts, and it really is the HL register of the 8080). So to enter a particular address, you type in the high half (in octal), press H. Then type in the low half and press L. The address is displayed on the port 0 and port 1 LEDs when KEX is running.

4) 'S' is 'Step' or 'Store'. It stores the working byte at the current address (in HL), and then increments the address. It's used to enter bytes into memory

5) 'G' is 'go'. It loads the 8080 PC with the address in HL, and thus executes a program at that address.

OK, this is what I would try.

1) Press 'R' to reset the 8080 and start KEX running.

2) Type 004 H 000 L  to load the start address of your program. The bytes should appear on the rightmost 8 LEDs as you enter them and should then also appear on the left and middle sets of LEDs when you press H and L.

3) Enter the program

076 S 123 S 323 S 000 S 166S

As you type each byte it should appear on the rightmost LEDs. When you press S, the address on the rest of the LEDs should increment by 1.

4) Re-enter the start address
004 H 000 L

5) Press G to run the program. The left most LEDs should change to .*.*..** (. = off, * = on), I think. The keys will then do nothing (as the CPU is halted) until you press R again to re-run KEX.


Cassette:
- The only info available is that an unknown UART is used on ports 12/13.
- Since MMD2 uses Kansas City format, it has been used here too. As there are no setup bytes, the UART is assumed to be the AY-3-1015 or equivalent. The result works perfectly.
- To save: 001H 025L G (start recording) press 0-7 to indicate number of blocks to save (0 = 8 blocks). The start address is always 1800. When it's finished, control will return.
- To load: 001H 000L (start playing), press G. When it's finished (cassette sound stops), press R. It always loads to 1800-up.

* Set MSByte of address by entering it on the keypad & pressing "HIGH".
* ... LSByte ... "LOW"
* Change contents of memory at the selected address by entering the new value & pressing "STORE".
* Look at adjacent memory locations with "NEXT" and "PREV".
* Execute the program at the selected address by pressing "GO".

AUX functions:

* BRL HI # - OFF disables BRL LO
* BRL LO #

The memory map can be rearranged by the system by using IN5, IN6, IN7.
A pair of undumped proms control what goes where on each map.
Each set of ROMs also has its own pair of PROMs.


I/O ports:
IN0: user expansion
IN1: 0-TTYIN, 1-CASSIN, 3-SW8(binary/ports), 4-SW7(reset/pup), 5-SW6(hex/oct), 6-(pup signal)
IN3: 8279 status
IN4: 8279 key
IN5: set MAP1
IN6: set MAP2
IN7: set MAP3
IN8: read eprom (in the eprom programmer)
OUT0: PORT0 LEDs

OUT3: 8279 control
OUT4: 8279 7-segment LED data
OUT5: TTYOUT, CASSOUT
OUT9: turn pup signal off
OUTA: programming pulse on/off (eprom programmer)

Dips:
SW1-4 hardware control of RAM being writable
SW5 not used
SW6 Control if the 7-segment displays show Octal (low) or Hex (high).
SW7 Reset only causes the cpu to perform a warm start. PUP does a cold start (Power-UP).
SW8 Control if the PORT displays echo the 7-segment displays (high), or just act as normal output ports (low).

TIPS:

Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?

Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.


How to activate Blood?

Hit [ F2 ], use the player 1 controls to navigate to "Setting up the soft dip", hit the primary button (Left Control), navigate to "Slot 1 (game name)", hit the primary button and finally navigate to the "Blood" selection and turn it on by hitting the primary button. To exit the menu, press the third button (Space) two times and select "Exit".

RUN files - run by themselves



Snapshot
--------
MTX files - wait for program to load then type RUN.
It may then do more loading, you'll hear cassette sounds.

Over half of these don't work. Perhaps there's other ways of starting them.

Of those that are obviously for the MTX, most of them want to load more, or don't respond to the keyboard.

In the end, there's not much that actually works.

--------
To save a tape: SAVE "x"

To load a tape: LOAD""

It might run itself, or you type RUN.

s2 - ?unknown
s3 - ?unknown but must be high for the keyboard to function
s4 - cassette motor on/off
s5 - ?unknown
- There is also switch s1 which it is not known what it connects to.
- Please note: The Takeda 80-column monitor expects the enter key to be the line feed key. This is the numpad-enter in our emulation. Strangely, the standard monitor, and Basic, will also respond to this key.
- The keyboard has a "English" key on the left, and a "Japan" key on the right. Pressing the appropriate key toggles the input language mode. Internally, this turns the Kana bit off/on. On our keyboard, the ALT key toggles between English and Kana.

Basic:
- To enter Basic, type BASIC. To quit, type EXIT.

Cassette:
- BIOS 0: you can SAVE and LOAD from the monitor, but not from Basic.
- BIOS 1: Doesn't seem to be supported.

Sound:
- BIOS 0: Sound is initialised with the volume turned off. In Basic, you can POKE 4382,144 to enable sound.
- BIOS 1: Doesn't appear to support sound. The included Basic has a SOUND command (e.g SOUND 127,80), but no sound is heard.

TANGERINE Oric1, Atmos, Telstrat
================================


Telestrat
---------
Completely not working. It wants a boot disk at start,
but it never reads it and just hangs there. There's an
option to use the microdisc or jasmin controllers but
they crash MAME.

If you use the inbuilt controller the maximum disk size
is 526KB - any more will get rejected.


Atmos
-----
Only works with tapes.


Oric-1
------
* Need to use jasmin or microdisc before floppies can be used.
Microdisc is preferred. Set up at least 2 drives so that the
non-bootable games can be run.

* Most disks will self-start. If not, enter DIR then the name
of a COM file. You can run a BAS file by including the extension.

* To change drives, enter B- (for example). Whenever referring to
a drive, use - (instead of :).

* Disks that have 99 tracks (1238KB) are rejected.

* Non-boot games will have the instructions in the filename.

So, [B- INSECT] means to boot Sedoric in A and the game in B.
Enter B- (to select B) then INSECT to start the game.

* OK disks can be selected from the "SW Files" and will auto-run.

PENNANT FEVER
=============
The first time run, the display will show the model number. Press F3 to clear this.

This is a baseball game where you aim for targets at the top of the playfield, and the
players advance towards a home run. There are no bumpers or other 'usual' pinball
items. 1 or 2 players.
Buttons: Pitch (Fast, Curve, Change Up), Bat.
How to play:
- Insert coin (credits shows in innings)
- Start game
- Player 1 is 'Visitors'; optional Player 2 is 'Home'
- To hit the ball and move to another base: Hit Y or U or I or O
- To get a home run: Hit B or N or M
- To miss (get a strike): Hit Alt or Space or LShift; then hit Z
- To get out immediately: Hit R or T.
- After that, wait for score to start flashing
- Press another key, etc
- When you have 3 Strikes, you are Out
- When you have 3 Outs, your Innings ends (other player gets a turn)
- After 3 Innings, it's game over.
- Match digit appears in Outs digit.

Commands:
A xxxx xxxx   - Assemble (from editor file): origin destination
D xxxx,xxxx   - Dump memory to host port
E             - Enter editor
- A           - Append at end of file
- C           - Clear memory file (reqires ESCAPE to confirm)
- D xx        - Delete line number xx
- I xx        - Insert at line xx
- L xx xx     - List range of lines
- Q           - Query: Display highest used address
- X           - eXit editor (requires ESCAPE to confirm)
- $ xxxx xxxx - exit directly to assembler
F             - set for Full-duplex host operation
G xxxx        - Go (execute) at address
H             - set for Half-duplex host operation
M xxxx,xxxx   - Display a range of memory (hex dump)
P xx xx-[xx.] - display/Edit I/O Port
S xxxx        - Substitute data into memory
T             - Transparent link to host (Ctrl-A exits)
U             - set host Uart parameters (8251 control registers)
V             - Virtual memory (Not used on PIMPS board)

Notes:

The 'D'ump command outputs memory to the host in some form of Intel HEX records, and waits for line-feed from the host before proceeding.

The 'V'irtual memory function was to control an EPROM emulator which was part of the original design (see Chucks notes below) and was not used on the PIMPS board.

Editor:
- Operates in HEXADECIMAL line numbers. Only supports up to 256 lines (01-00). You must enter full two-digit number when prompted. You MUST 'C'lear the memory file before you begin, otherwise you will be editing random memory content.

Assembler:
- Comment is an INSTRUCTION! - this means that you need to put at least one space before and after ';' when entering a line comment.

- Does not understand DECIMAL numbers. It understands character constants ('c' and 'cc') and hex numbers ($xx or $xxxx).

- 8-bit values MUST contain two hex digits or one quoted character. 16-bit constants MUST contain four hex digits or two quoted characters.

- Use 'S' instead of 'SP', eg: LXI S,$1000

- Only EQU, DB, DW and END directives are supported. An END statement is REQUIRED (otherwise you get the message '?tab-ful' as it fills the symbol table with garbage occuring in memory after the end of the file).

- RST instructions are implemented as 8 separate 'RST0'-'RST8' memonics.

To save a tape: MGSV nn a b [name]  (where nn = 2-digit key, a = start address, b = end address, name is optional up to 8 characters)

To load a tape: MGLD nn        (where nn = required 2-digit key)


Take note of the filenames - each ends with the 2-digit key enclosed in square brackets, e.g.[00].

Some have an additional type:
B - basic
26 - unknown
If none specified then it's M/L.

If the 2nd parameter has 4 digits then it's the start address.



Load the tape: MGLD nn <enter>
------------------------------

So, get the key [nn], enter MGLD nn (it says ?) then start the tape.

If the tape is ok, you get some info

nn/t "name"

nn = the key
t = type
? (3F) - M/L
> (3E) - Basic
& (26) - unknown app


At the end it will either run by itself, or say ? again.


Run the program: JUMP 0000 <enter>
----------------------------------

Use the start address if specified, otherwise try 0000.




--------------------------------------------------------------------


BASIC
-----

NOTE: Loading of Basic programs isn't working at this time.

PMD851 - BASIC nn to run basic

Others: BASIC starts by default.

LOAD nn - load a basic program.

The MGLD nn command can still be used to load M/L programs.


--------------------------------------------------------------------


Getting info by looking in files
--------------------------------

Use HxD to open any filetype (except WAV), look for a string of 55 bytes, the first byte after is nn, the next is tt. nn must be converted to decimal, and tt to character.

So, if it says 16 3E, that means the key is 22, type is Basic.

To save a tape: S aaaa = bb = Record = (it saves)  (aaaa = start address, bb = number of bytes)

To load a tape: L aaaa = bb = Play = (it loads)

However, the tape system is not working.

Notes:
- The hex keys are 0 through 9, A through F on our keyboard
- The function key labels are RE, I, EX, R, BR, M, L, S, =
- The letter M shows as an inverted U in the display
- Turn it on, it says ''PMI -80''
- Press any key, it shows a ? at the left
- Press the function key corresponding to what you want to do
- Press the numbers to select an address or whatever
- For example, press M then enter an address, press =, enter data, press =  to increment to next address or to scan through them.

INITIALIZATION:

If you are having trouble controlling vehicle or the brake is always on, calibration must be done!
First off, Delete any .NV (NVRAM) file for this game contained in your NVRAM directory, called harddriv.nv or racedriv.nv or the same as the setname you intend to use. You need to understand how the controls are mapped in MAME. It's not very intuitive, so pay attention:

Steering Wheel: Player 1 Paddle control, by default maps to the mouse and the [ Left/Right Arrow ] keys.
Gas Pedal: Pedal 1 control, by default maps to the [ Left Control ] key. Pressing the key will quickly depress the analog control; releasing the key will release it.
Brake Pedal: Pedal 2 control, by default maps to the [ Left Alt ] key. Operates the same way as the gas pedal.
Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.
Key: Maps to Player 1 start button (default: [ 1 ] key).
Abort: Maps to Player 2 start button (default: [ 2 ] key).

Finally, here is a step-by-step tour through the calibration process. Note that even if you have an analog control connected to any of the analog controls in the game, it is much easier to do calibration with the keyboard.
* Take your hands and feet off all controls then turn key. Make absolutely sure you haven't touched any of the controls up to this point, then press the [ 1 ] key.
* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

TIPS:

Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

INITIALIZATION:

If you are having trouble controlling vehicle or the brake is always on, calibration must be done!
First off, Delete any .NV (NVRAM) file for this game contained in your NVRAM directory, called harddriv.nv or racedriv.nv or the same as the setname you intend to use. You need to understand how the controls are mapped in MAME. It's not very intuitive, so pay attention:

Steering Wheel: Player 1 Paddle control, by default maps to the mouse and the [ Left/Right Arrow ] keys.
Gas Pedal: Pedal 1 control, by default maps to the [ Left Control ] key. Pressing the key will quickly depress the analog control; releasing the key will release it.
Brake Pedal: Pedal 2 control, by default maps to the [ Left Alt ] key. Operates the same way as the gas pedal.
Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.
Key: Maps to Player 1 start button (default: [ 1 ] key).
Abort: Maps to Player 2 start button (default: [ 2 ] key).

Finally, here is a step-by-step tour through the calibration process. Note that even if you have an analog control connected to any of the analog controls in the game, it is much easier to do calibration with the keyboard.
* Take your hands and feet off all controls then turn key. Make absolutely sure you haven't touched any of the controls up to this point, then press the [ 1 ] key.
* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

TIPS:

Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

First off, Delete any .NV (NVRAM) file for this game contained in your NVRAM directory, called harddriv.nv or racedriv.nv or the same as the setname you intend to use. You need to understand how the controls are mapped in MAME. It's not very intuitive, so pay attention:

Steering Wheel: Player 1 Paddle control, by default maps to the mouse and the [ Left/Right Arrow ] keys.
Gas Pedal: Pedal 1 control, by default maps to the [ Left Control ] key. Pressing the key will quickly depress the analog control; releasing the key will release it.
Brake Pedal: Pedal 2 control, by default maps to the [ Left Alt ] key. Operates the same way as the gas pedal.
Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.
Key: Maps to Player 1 start button (default: [ 1 ] key).
Abort: Maps to Player 2 start button (default: [ 2 ] key).

Finally, here is a step-by-step tour through the calibration process. Note that even if you have an analog control connected to any of the analog controls in the game, it is much easier to do calibration with the keyboard.
* Take your hands and feet off all controls then turn key. Make absolutely sure you haven't touched any of the controls up to this point, then press the [ 1 ] key.
* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

TIPS:

Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

Clutch Pedal: Pedal 3 control, by default maps to the [ Space ] key. Operates the same way as the gas and brake pedals.
Key: Maps to Player 1 start button (default: [ 1 ] key).
Abort: Maps to Player 2 start button (default: [ 2 ] key).

Finally, here is a step-by-step tour through the calibration process. Note that even if you have an analog control connected to any of the analog controls in the game, it is much easier to do calibration with the keyboard.
* Take your hands and feet off all controls then turn key. Make absolutely sure you haven't touched any of the controls up to this point, then press the [ 1 ] key.
* Turn wheel counterclockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Left key for about 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the 1 key while still holding down the left arrow. It should say New min 256.
* Turn wheel clockwise as far as it will go then turn key. At this point, press and hold the Right key for about 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the right arrow. It should say Max 3840.
* Put transmission in first then turn key and release. Since first gear is in the upper-left corner, press and hold the [ D ] and [ R ] keys for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ D ] and [ R ] keys.
* Put transmission in fourth then turn key again. Since fourth gear is in the lower-right corner, press and hold the [ F ] and [ G ] keys for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, press the [ 1 ] key while still holding down the [ F ] and [ G ] keys.
* Move seat full forward then turn key and release. Since the seat feedback isn't implemented in the MAME driver, just go ahead and press the [ 1 ] key here.
* Move fully back and to side then turn key again. Just press the 1 key here again to move on.
* Take your foot off the brake turn key to abort. Now this is the tricky part. When you see this screen do nothing. Wait for a couple of seconds until it displays New max 4064. Do NOT press the 1 key prematurely here or you will screw up the calibration!

Now step on brake firmly and release. Do this by pressing and holding the [ Left Alt ] key for 3 seconds, and then letting go. If all is well, it should display Range 4064 and move on to the game.

TIPS:

Gameplay is choppy at times, but I have enough CPU power?
Although the FPS counter shows 100% speed for these games, they may appear choppy. This is true to the original — even the original hardware of these games struggled with them and therefore the choppiness is actually accurate emulation of these games. You may be able to get rid of it in some cases by using the -cheat parameter, hitting the tilde key and browsing the on screen menu until you find "CPU overclocking". This will run the emulated CPU faster which may or may not fix it. It may also cause the emulation to have errors, so don't bug people if overclocking screws up a game.

INITIALIZATION:

RAT RACE
========
The first time run, the display will show the model number. Press F3 to clear this.

Rat Race is played in a cocktail cabinet, the player uses a joystick to tilt the
board, to coax the ball into following lit passages in a maze. After a successful
navigation, the maze changes to something else faster and harder. It's almost an
arcade game done mechanically. Obviously there is no way to emulate it in its intended
form. Probably would have been a nice game, but it never passed the prototype stage.

How to play: Press 5, press 1. If you want 2 players, also press 2. The display flashes
the ball number. Press Z to get the ball into play. The display alternates between the
score and the seconds remaining to accomplish the task. After the series of passages
has been followed, a bonus flashes for a few seconds, which you must also run over.
While one player is playing, the other player's score shows what seem to be random
numbers (but probably are not). The real machine does this too.
If time runs out, the ball is over. After 3 balls, it's game over.

TIPS:

The volume for this game is TOO LOW!

When the game is running, hit [ F2 ] to get to the internal service menu. Hit [ F2 ] again to "close" the service switch so that you won't get stuck in the menu. Now, navigate to the "Volume Adjust" option (following the directions provided) and adjust the volume. It's best to keep the volume no more than 80-90% filled as it might cause your sound to be overdriven and crackle. When adjusted, simply exit the menu.

How do I calibrate the guns? Can I use a real light gun?

The game will automatically ask you to calibrate the guns when you start the game for the first time. Simply put, use your mouse or keyboard to "target" the top left corner when the game asks so. There aren't any visual cues to help this, so you'll have to go by the numerical coordinates that are visible on the screen. The numbers you see are in a simple 8-bit scale going from 0 to 255. To "target" the top left corner, keep moving your mouse until you get P1 X and P1 Y as near to 0 as possible. The middle is located at about 127, 127, and the bottom right corner as close to 255 as possible. Repeat the process for the second player. As for the light gun, the short answer is no. A longer answer is that the game didn't actually have a light gun — it had analog joysticks mounted as guns, and emulating them with a proper light gun is not viable. Try to use mouse control with this game.

When the game is running, hit [ F2 ] to get to the internal service menu. Hit [ F2 ] again to "close" the service switch so that you won't get stuck in the menu. Now, navigate to the "Volume Adjust" option (following the directions provided) and adjust the volume. It's best to keep the volume no more than 80-90% filled as it might cause your sound to be overdriven and crackle. When adjusted, simply exit the menu.

How do I calibrate the guns? Can I use a real light gun?

The game will automatically ask you to calibrate the guns when you start the game for the first time. Simply put, use your mouse or keyboard to "target" the top left corner when the game asks so. There aren't any visual cues to help this, so you'll have to go by the numerical coordinates that are visible on the screen. The numbers you see are in a simple 8-bit scale going from 0 to 255. To "target" the top left corner, keep moving your mouse until you get P1 X and P1 Y as near to 0 as possible. The middle is located at about 127, 127, and the bottom right corner as close to 255 as possible. Repeat the process for the second player. As for the light gun, the short answer is no. A longer answer is that the game didn't actually have a light gun — it had analog joysticks mounted as guns, and emulating them with a proper light gun is not viable. Try to use mouse control with this game.

BANDAI RX-78
============

Notes:
- BS-BASIC v1.0 notes:
-- COLOR x doesn't do anything. It sets a memory location with x, but does nothing with it.
-- COLOR x,y where y sets the background colour. This part works.
-- When BASIC is first started, it sets the colours but doesn't save the information. So when COLOR x is entered, although x has no effect, it also sets the background colour, which not having been set, sets the background black.
-- At the first scroll, the display memory is disrupted in the logo area, probably another btanb. After that, scrolling works correctly.
-- Need a real machine to confirm these problems, but if true, one can only wonder how such obvious issues made it out the door.
- To save a tape: SAVE
- To load a tape: LOAD
- To interrupt a LOAD, press STOP + SHIFT keys (this combination is the BREAK key).

Summary of Monitor commands.
- The monitor is entered at bootup. The prompt is the * character. This is followed by a command letter (upper case). Some commands require hex parameters. You must enter all 4 characters of these. No spaces allowed except where shown.
- While in BASIC, you may enter the monitor by using the MON command. After you have finished, you can return to BASIC by entering the command *J2005.

- Tape commands:
*L Load a tape
*V Verify a tape
*S Save a block of memory to tape. You are asked for a filename (blank is allowed), the start address, the end address, and the Jump address (where it should begin execution)

- Memory commands:
*Dnnnn nnnn Displays a hex dump in the address range entered
*Mnnnn      Allows you to examine and modify memory. Enter to skip to next, period (.) to quit.
*Jnnnn      Transfer execution (Jump) to a program in memory at the specified address

- Other:
*R          This is a block transfer load from a mystery parallel device, using ports E0 and E1, using handshaking similar to a centronics printer. The incoming file is loaded into memory and it appears that the operator is not provided any information of what happened.

Carts
-----

Run by themselves.




Cassettes
---------

Firstly need to find out if the tape is for Basic, so load "basic" from swlist. Then use LOAD.

If you get error 18 then it's a M/L program, so MON then L then the program name that Basic gave you.

When it's finished you're back to Basic. RUN to start it.



If you don't use the Basic cart, the system will start in Monitor and expect a tape, L is already printed for you to
press enter. Note that a tape will immediately begin playing at start, even before you hit enter.

At end it will say something like
LOADING GRM0044 3780 01D4 2005
2005 EC00

Use the J command to run it, in this case (don't know)

Keyboard notes and BTANBs:

- Keyboards on all models are identical, except on UK101 where ^ replaces LINE FEED.

- When run for the first time, the keyboard is in lowercase. Shift will correctly select uppercase. Special keys do weird things, but come good when Shift pressed. Since all input MUST be uppercase, the first thing to do is press Capslock (which is SHIFT LOCK on the real machine). This is saved in your cfg file on exit.

- After that, uppercase works correctly, as do the other keys. Pressing Shift will now do odd things to the letters, and they become random symbols.

- Natural keyboard is set up to take advantage of these oddities and get the maximum symbols available, however lowercase is not available. Natural keyboard will only work correctly when the SHIFT LOCK is engaged.

The idea of this device is that you write a 8085 program with an assembler on your PC.  You then compile it, and then send it to the SITCOM via a serial cable. The program then (hopefully) runs on the SITCOM.  With the 8255 expansion, you could wire up input devices or other hardware for your program to use.

The SOD LED blinks slowly while waiting; stays on while downloading; and blinks quickly if an error occurs.

After a successful upload, hit the Reset button to mirror RAM into the low 32kB of the address space in place of ROM and run the program.

The null modem bitbanger should be configured for 9600 8N1 to upload a program.  The data should be in Intel HEX format.

All games (except where noted below)
- To start, press 1
- Wait for score to flash before you can score (first ball can take a while, jiggle XZ to push things along)
- Press X to end ball
- Ball counter runs backwards, so 1 = last ball.
- When on the last ball, scoring points racks up a bonus counter. At the end, you get an extra timed part, with infinite balls until the time runs out. Then press X.

==========

System Setup (to play games etc).
- In the Dipswitches (not the Configuration), turn cursor flashing OFF.
- Loading via wav files works, so load a tape image in the file manager
- In UPPER CASE, enter XE press enter, cassette will load.
- At the end, the program will start by itself.
- When it says use 2,4,6,8 keys, you can use the keyboard arrow keys.

Monitor Commands:
- TE - return to terminal mode
- DU - dump memory
- EN - modify memory
- EX - Go (execute)
- CU - Insert or remove a custom command
- SE - Set parameters (eg tape speed)
- SA - Save
- GE - Load
- XE - Load and run
- CA - List the files on a tape

How to use the music system:
1. Choose the "music" item from the software list
2. Type XEQ press Enter
3. When the program starts, press R, you are back in the monitor
4. Type GET press Enter
5. When this finishes loading, type EX 0 press Enter, there's no response
6. Press F, wait for numbers to appear
7. Press S, wait for numbers to appear
8. Press P, music will be heard (it isn't very loud)

Cassette
--------
To save a tape: SA name a b (where a = start address, b = end address)

To load a tape: GE

To list files on a tape: CA

To load a tape and autorun it: XE


Info shows when load is finished

progname progbyte start size

If preceeded by ERROR, then a load error occurred



If start address is 1AD9, then the game is for BASIC/5.

If start address is 3C20, then it's for EXTENDED BASIC.




In BASIC, use GET to load a file. Annoyingly you need to supply other parameters as well.

GET name,type

name is the progname
type is C or S (not sure yet).




Paste
-----
Most of the unsupported stuff is text and can be pasted in.

$end
$info=sorcerer
$mame
INITIALIZATION:

All input to be in UPPERcase.

To set the tape speed:
-  SE T=0  (1200 baud - the default)
-  SE T=1  (300 baud)

To set the autoexec address: SE X=nnnn  (where nnnn = exec address)

To set the file character: SE F=cc      (where cc is a hex number - it is displayed in ascii upon loading)

To save a tape: SA name a b   (where name = filename (1-5 characters), a = start address, b = end address)

To load a tape: LO

To load and autorun a tape: LOG  (only for M/L tapes where an exec address has been set

So, when saving:
- Set the tape speed
- If it can be autoexecuted, set the autoexec address (for Basic programs use the address C858)
- Set the file character   (programs loaded via Basic must be Bx; the special code D8 prevents auto-execution)
- Decide on a name (it's advisable to be normal characters A-Z,0-9. The first character must be A-F or H-Z)
- Find out the address range to save
- Then save with the format listed above

In Basic:
- To save a tape: CSAVE name
- To load a tape: CLOAD
- To load and run a tape: CLOADG


Sorcerer Floppy Disks
---------------------
There's no standards; all the different hardware solutions used non-compatible floppy formats.

Disk system on sorcererd:
- Uses a Micropolis controller. Top of RAM is BBFF.
- To boot CP/M, insert the 325k disk, then type GO BC00 at the monitor prompt.
- To try the video/disk unit, insert the 78k disk, then type GO BF00 at the monitor prompt.
(see notes below)

Disk system on sorcerera:
- Uses an almost-Microbee clone board called the Dreamdisk.
- To boot, just insert the proper 841k disk. The bios will wait for it.

Disk system on sorcererb:
- SCUAMON will try using ports 30,32,34 and 38. Uses digitrio hardware (also a 841k disk).
scuamon64 requires you to enter DI to boot, and it doesn't work, confirmed buggy.
scuamon80 will successfully boot by itself, but the 80 column display is of course scrambled.

Other disk-enabled bioses:
- TVIMON uses ports 04,30-34. Type in BO to attempt to boot. Unknown hardware.
- There's a bunch of 251k disks, also requiring unknown hardware.

Exidy Sorcerer Video/Disk Unit:
- Contains a screen and 2 floppy drives. No details available. Partial
emulation done but it's all guesswork. The unit contains 2 dipswitch units
(one has 4 switches and the other has 8), a 8 MHz crystal, 3 proms and a
FD1793-B01 fdc. Going by the code, it would appear to place the Z-80 into
WAIT while reading a sector. To try it out: GO BF00 at the monitor prompt.
Currently the CP/M sign-on message appears, followed by lockup due to a
fdc problem. Uses ports 28-2C. Run it under debug, when it gets stuck you'll
see the A register has 21. Change it to 24 and it will boot up and work.

INITIALIZATION:

The first time run, the machine will show some numbers. Press F3 to clear this.

Each game consists of a flat board with an air-driven puck and 10 bowling pins.
You must push the puck as if it was a bowling ball, and score strikes and spares.
The displays have 4 digits and 6 can play. The board has contactors to detect
the passage of the puck, and the machine will lift the bowling pins out of the
way, so in fact the puck never touches the pins at all.

- To play: 5,1,(optional: 3 to select game type), any of keys A-W,Y,Z,comma,period
to activate puck detectors, X to signal end. Press it twice to end a frame.
- To score a strike, press ABCDFGIX one at a time.

The volume for this game is TOO LOW!


When the game is running, hit [ F2 ] to get to the internal service menu. Hit [ F2 ] again to "close" the service switch so that you won't get stuck in the menu. Now, navigate to the "Volume Adjust" option (following the directions provided) and adjust the volume. It's best to keep the volume no more than 80-90% filled as it might cause your sound to be overdriven and crackle. When adjusted, simply exit the menu.

Setting it up:

When you first start WMG, you need to initialise the NVRAM properly. Do this by starting wmg, pressing 1 to cycle through the games list, pressing 2 to run the game. When it says "FACTORY SETTINGS RESTORED", press F3 to return to the menu. Repeat this procedure for all 6 games. After that, quit wmg, then restart. On the Setup menu you can personalise the settings with the 1 and 2 keys. The inputs default to be the same as on the original hardware. You may change any input individually for each game. Note that the WMG hardware has the Flap and Inviso buttons wired together. JOUST can be played by 2 players at the same time, player 1 uses the left joystick and the Flap button, while player 2 uses the right joystick and the Fire button. SPLAT would normally require 4 joysticks, but since the WMG only has 2, it is limited to a one-player game. Cocktail mode is not supported, WMG must be played on an upright only. After playing a game, returning to the menu will return to the place you left from. You can force a return to the Setup by Auto Up and pressing F3. You can also clear out the menu's NVRAM (not the game's NVRAM), by holding down L and pressing F3.

You'll see a number show up for the value "RF/AMT" if done correctly. After this value is set, return to the game by taking off the [ K ] and [ J ] keys.

TIPS:

The volume for this game is TOO LOW!
When the game is running, hit [ F2 ] to get to the internal service menu. Hit [ F2 ] again to "close" the service switch so that you won't get stuck in the menu. Now, navigate to the "Volume Adjust" option (following the directions provided) and adjust the volume. It's best to keep the volume no more than 80-90% filled as it might cause your sound to be overdriven and crackle. When adjusted, simply exit the menu.

TIPS:

You need to calibrate the game each time it is played. The calibration settings are not saved at the moment (lack of nvram support) but the settings are kept in memory using [ F3 ] after setting, so once set you can play with the calibrated settings.

TO SET: Use [ F2 ] (Service Mode) and then reset [ F3 ] or restart MAME. Use [ CTRL ] or [ ALT ] and highlight "7. Gun Adjust Mode". Hit [ 1 ] (P1 Start) two times to begin gun adjustments. Just follow the directions, aiming at the targets for both guns. When done, use [ F2 ] to shut off Service Mode and reset [ F3 ]. It is important not to hard reset or restart MAME, doing such would lose the gun settings and you'll need to re-calibrate.
