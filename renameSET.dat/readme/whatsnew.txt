2023/04/25 13.06: Now my work on 'allMAMEset' focuses on naming people who have added machines to MAME over the years; regarding ex-MESS machines these data are deduced from my other file 'messinfo.dat' the rest from 'mameinfo.dat' of MASH; in the latter case, however, only the authors of the parent machines are found in the file, so I'll have to look for the rest in the MAME 'Whatsnew' files. This too will be a huge job that will take a very long time to finished. Currently this section is only 00.00% complete. If I don't find reliable information, I will write "MAME Team" in this field.
2023/04/24 13.05: The correction work of 'allMAMEset', which finally completes my idea of 'mameID' (i.e. an ID that unequivocally identifies each machine/bios/device added to the MAME) has consequently also made changes to other files, such as 'allMAMErenamed' , 'allMAMEremoved', 'renameSET.dat' and 'renameSET.ini'.
