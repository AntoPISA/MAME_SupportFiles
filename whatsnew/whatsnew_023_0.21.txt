Program:
--------
- Added colors to Warp Warp. Thanks again Chris.
- Added support for Donkey Kong japanese version.
- Arabian has correct colors now.
- Fixed a bug in all games with starbackground:  using a frameskip > 0 introduced slowdowns. Now the speed remains unchanged.
- Fixed Dipswitch in Elevator Action. YOU'LL HAVE TO DELETE THE PREVIOUS DSW FILE IN "ELEVATOB" DIRECTORY IN ORDER TO GET IT RUN CORRECTLY.
- Fixed tempo speed in 1942. It was playing at half speed. Should be correct now. Also fixed a bug in noise volume of PSG. Noise was playing at half volume.
- I'd like to say I'v finished, but Nicola is too fast as always! ;) So thanks to Nicola we have GALAGA!! And very special thanks to Martin Scragg that provided us crucial information on custon I/O chips.
- Mad Planets doesn't crash anymore with the new samples (shorter!).
- Minor adjustment to Space Invaders color strips.
- Thank to Virtu-Al (Alan J McCormick (gonzothegreat@JUNO.COM)) Amidar and Turtles now have 100% correct colors.
- Thanks to Dark Schneider (DS wanted to be anonymous, so I'll call him this way) that provided 6809 support and the first driver working on this CPU: Super Pac Man. The driver is based on the super-detailed KEG file of Replay emulator by Kevin Brisley (kevin@isgtec.com). Thanks to everyone.
- Ville Laitinen provided a driver for Kangaroo, based on the Arabian hardware. I'v also adjusted the number of frames per second to 60 to the two drivers. Sync with sound should be better, though.

Sources:
--------
- Added M6809 CPU support. Changes in CPUIntrf.c and Driver.h to accomodate the new CPU.
- Added MasterVolume in MSDOS.C, and changed MAME.C to support this feature. You can change the volume thru various volume percentage [100,75,50,25,0] pressing F9.
- Changes in COMMON.H for the sample structure. Now it has infos on replayrate, resolution and volume of the sample to be played. BE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE NEW SET OF SAMPLES, OR THE "MAMESAM" CONVERTER OR YOU WILL GET NO SOUND FOR SAMPLE BASED GAMES!!
- I'v added redefinable keys in MAME. A new structure cointains which input ports and bits have a certain meaning. The KEY settings will be saved in a .KEY file, in the game directory.
- Nicola introduced changes to the Z80 emulator code that intercept some sorts of tight loop used during an interrupt waitstate. Normal games should not be affected, while Galaga and 1942 are now very fast!!
- Sound is freezed now during GFXView, Pause and DipSwitch settings.[Ahhh! ;)]
