Source changes:
---------------
- Documented the www.segaresurrection.com decrypted Ninja Kids II sound ROM so it doesn't show up as newly "found" bootleg version [Brian Troha].
- Converted downtown, gondo, hbarrel, midres, timesold, topgunbl to use IPT_POSITIONAL [Derrick Renaud].
- Fixed Analog Settings to return to default when IPT_UI_SELECT (enter) pressed. Fixed misplaced brackets, allowing upper/lower case extensions for crosshair graphics and ldplayer chd files [Derrick Renaud].
- Naomi updates [Angelo Salese, David Haywood]:
  * Added H-Blank IN interrupt hook-up.
  * Generate a few more interrupts (ISP end of render, VIDEO end of render).
  * Some minor improvements to the irq system.
  * Added a bunch of Maple-DMA fixes, now moeru boots too.
- Factored out MESS-specific code from machine/atari.c (cart init, loading & unloading) [Fabio Priuli].
- Correctly implemented 'trail' function in ninjakd2 [kanikani].
- Changed galgbios service switch to be a toggle [David Haywood].
- Fixed CPU_GET_INFO issues spotted by -validate in MESS debug build [Fabio Priuli].
- Added Dip Locations to jalmah.c [Fabio Priuli].
- Improved test mode behaviour on the jalmah.c [Angelo Salese].
- Added display of frame number to the beamx/y info in the register view in the debugger [Aaron Giles].
- Munch Mobile improvements [robiza]:
  * Implemented priorities.
  * Removed unnecessary tile index check.
- Memory map merging for naughtyb.c, ssrj.c [Angelo Salese].
- Converted jangou & nightgal drivers to use resistors with the color proms [Angelo Salese].
- Reverted to older behavior for how modified input port fields are handled. The originally intended behavior is that a new field that intersected a previous field would completely wipe out the original field. Recently a change was made that changed the behavior to only remove a portion of the bits from the original field. This is actually problematic behavior, so the original behavior was restored [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed auto-center bug on analog joysticks [Derrick Renaud].
- Fixed UI when modifying the inc/dec/analog fields of an analog control in sequence [Derrick Renaud].
- Corrected System 1 Z80 clocking [Aaron Giles]:
  * Each opcode fetch is 2 cycles with /M1 low, so each byte of opcode fetching causes slightly longer delays than the previous tables.
  * Implemented approximate wait state timing for videoram access; further accuracy will rely on getting a dump of the PAL16R4 that controls the horizontal video timing.
- Merged memory maps in taito_l.c, taito_x.c, taito_b.c, taito_f2.c, taito_f3.c, surpratk.c, system16.c, system18.c. Also removed some word handlers in favor of using READ8/WRITE8 directly in address maps. Removed some additional unnecessary handlers in favor of using AM_READ_PORT [Aaron Giles].
- Changed the PPU2C0x implementation to be a device [Nathan Woods].
- Simplified the gun port handling in the Sammy Outdoor Shooting games [Derrick Renaud].
- Small System 1 update [Aaron Giles]:
  * Correct video timing.
  * Removed "small" video drivers for games that properly mask the scrolling areas.
- Correct sound ROM for T-Mek 4.4 [Lars Bull].
- Partial fix to bug MT 3070 (harddriv & racedriv do not show anymore P2 inputs for analog controls). Still thinking about steeltal [Fabio Priuli].
