Source changes:

- Fixed a number of errors and simplified the code significantly in the ptm6840 code [Atari Ace].
- Fixed offset for sprite and layers in fcrash driver [Robiza].
- SH4 CPU core improvements [Samuele Zannoli]:
  * Corrected opcode decoding and decodes all opcodes of sh4;
  * Corrected disassembly and added support for all instruction of sh4 not in sh2;
  * Now disassembles all fpu instructions;
  * Changed cpu to little-endian (sh4 can be either big or little);
  * Corrected which data is read and written from memory;
  * Added registers fpul and dbr;
  * Added (non-fpu) instructions of sh4 non present in sh2;
  * Added four fpu instructions;

- Updated CPS2 decryption bit order to match what is likely the original order [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed a few warnings that show up with -Wextra [Atari Ace, Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed toaplan2.c so that OKI6295 sample ROM bankswitching via one of the spare data lines on the coin mechanism port is only hooked up in the one game that's actually wired this way (shippumd) [AWJ].
- Updated the scrambls protection implementation to use equations based on the implementation from fpgaarcade.com [Mark McDougall].
- Improved GCD computations in the rendlay.c code [Christophe Jaillet].
- Fixed numerous regressions in the 0.116 release [Zsolt Vasvari, Aaron Giles].
- Switched driver code to exclusively using mame_rand() instead of rand(), to improve consistency of results [Aaron Giles].
- Improved MCU timing and communication in the qix driver. Still a few issues remain [Aaron Giles].
