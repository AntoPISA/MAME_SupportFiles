Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed behavior of auto_realloc() so that it always reallocs from its original pool [Atari Ace].
- Fixed divide-by-zero when running with -video none in some cases [Atari Ace].

ARM7 core fixes: [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz]
 - Fixed behavior when R15 is the source of a MOV
 - Fixed flags calc for ADC/SBC
 - Fixed flags calc for NEG
 - Fixed flags calc for CMP
 - Fixed time running backwards on Thumb instructions
 - Fixed some ARM instructions doing indiscriminate change_pc()s

Fixed converting CD's containing audio that were ripped by cdrdao, 
which was broken recently. The code is cleaner and more maintainable 
now [smf].

Fixed chdman_open() "w" to always create/truncate the file, leaving 
"r+" to try opening first and then truncating. This matches behavior
in the core [smf].

Added missing port 3/4 to M6803 cpu core [Curt Coder].

Changed 6850ACIA to use MSB/LSB read handlers [Curt Coder].

Fixed two minor bugs in the COP400 CPU disassembler. Hooked up the 
internal 64 bytes of DATA RAM to the core. [Andrew Gardner]

Added support in the debugger for reading/writing memory without
translation. [Olivier Galibert]

MSM6242 updates: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Added support for 12/24 hour mode
 - Added support for the HOLD bit
 
Galaxian driver updates: [stephh]
 - fixed 'spcdraga' GFX ROMS loading
 - 100% verified Dip Switches for all sets
 - added long notes for all sets
 
Significantly revamped the tilemap rendering code. There are now only
two tilemap types, based on whether or not you want transparency
based on pen or color. All existing tilemap effects are built on top
of these two modes. The internal tilemap handling code has been
reorganized and simplified in a number of cases. For most games, this
change is transparent (har har), apart from the change in tilemap
type values. Several concepts within the tilemap system now have
different terminology for clarity and to remove some ambiguous naming
('priority', for example, was overloaded). A small tutorial and better
documentation is now present at the top of tilemap.h and provides
more details of the changes. [Aaron Giles]
