Source changes:
---------------
- Added simulation of protection to the Parallel Turn driver [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Added missing demo sounds DIP switch to spelunk2 [Roberto Fresca].
- Fixed key input problems in many of the Nichibutsu mahjong drivers [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Updated the Dragonball Z games to use the K056832 chip emulation, fixing color offsets and priorities [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Updated raw mouse support for Windows XP [Derrick Renaud]:
  * Reversed the RAWMOUSE device list. RAWMOUSE reports the last installed mouse as the first device. I now place new mice at the end;
  * Added clipping to RAWMOUSE support so the cursor does not leave the game area in Windowed mode. Also fixed the non-RAWMOUSE Windowed mode clipping I broke by my last changes;
  * You can now see the names of the mice attached by using -verbose;
  * Changed Lightgun functionality if using XP. You no longer need to use -lightgun or -dual_lightgun. Use -mouse and multiple (2+) "HID-compliant mouse" lightguns will be detected. Lightgun support in Win98/Me remains unchanged. -offscreen_reload can still be used on Win98/Me/XP. See windows.txt for further info.
- Fixed indirect palettes in the System 32 driver. This fixes Sonic graphics finally [anonymous].
- Fixed window resizing bug when running in a window [Wilbert Pol].
- Switched MDEC decoding input from CbCrY to CrCbY, and switched MDEC 15bit output from rgb to bgr [smf].
- Removed unnecessary #includes from a number of files. Added #includes to files that were defining items that were declared in the header. Better documented where items are defined in the header files from the includes directory [Atari Ace].
- Fixed some crashes in the debugger if you tried to set breakpoints while the game was running and there was no active CPU [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed crash when calling fatalerror before the system was ready for it [Nathan Woods].
- More improvements to the Sega universal sound board. Star Trek is almost identical to the samples. 'Tac/Scan' is not that far off, surprisingly [Aaron Giles].
- Added new function input_port_set_changed_callback() which lets you receive a change notification when certain bits in an input port have changed. See sega.c for an example [Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles].
- Added new PORT_CUSTOM() macro which allows you to specify a callback to return the value of bits in an input port. This saves you from needing to intercept the port read and modify the bits there. See sega.c for an example [Aaron Giles].
- Added new PORT_DIPLOCATION() macro which allows you to specify the physical PCB location of a DIP switch and the switches that correspond to the bits in the DIPSETTING. See sega.c for an example [Aaron Giles].
- Updated the i8039 disassembler to the new interface [Aaron Giles].
- Moved read/write handlers for input ports, watchdog, and interrupt enable out of the core and into machine/generic.c. Moved generic palette hanlders out of the core and into vidhrdw/generic.c. Clarified the names of many of the palette handlers and simplified the code [Aaron Giles].
- Added code to the UI to sort the per-game inputs in a standard order [Aaron Giles].
