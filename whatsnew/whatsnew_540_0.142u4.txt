- 04350: [Graphics] buggyboy, buggyboyjr: Missing/corrupt graphics (Alex Jackson)
- 04346: [Graphics] dangar, galivan and clones: Scrolling incorrectly changes scene (Angelo Salese)


Source changes:
---------------
- Removed deprecat.h usage for the following drivers: galpanic.c, gradius3.c, halleys.c, hexion.c [Angelo Salese].
- Inputs from the scratch for Champion Poker (v100) [Roberto Fresca].
- Cleaned-up protection simulation in Yam Yam!? [Angelo Salese].
- Implemented an almost complete Konami k053252 device emulation, adds accurate refresh rate timings and irq acks to many mid-90-era Konami games [Angelo Salese, O.Galibert].
- Various changes for PSX HW [smf]:
  * Modernised internal memory map.
  * MDEC is now an internal device of the PlayStation CPU.
  * Root counter & Serial I/O converted to internal CPU devices.
  * Moved PlayStation IRQ code to sub device of the CPU.
- Switch input ports to use function-based constructors instead of tokens. Remove the old tokenizing helpers. Add basic classes for ports, fields, settings, and dip locations as a first step. These will be fully cleaned up later. Added machine() method to field to hide all the necessary indirection. Changed custom/changed handlers into generic read/write handlers, and added wrappers to convert them to device read/write lines [Aaron Giles].
- Changed input read/write and crosshair callbacks into delegates. Changed signature for callbacks to take an input_field_config reference instead of pointer [Aaron Giles].
- Removed legacy trampolines from eeprom_device, taking advantage of new input port support for delegates [Aaron Giles].
- mc6845.c: Converted to C++ [Wilbert Pol].
- Fixed the disassembly of the "mov ax, mem" instructions (opcodes A0-A3) in the i386 and NEC disassemblers. The argument (the memory address) was being displayed as a signed number, which doesn't make any sense [Alex Jackson].
- Fixed a tiny bug with the debugger hex dump command: the printable characters in ASCII range from 32 to 12*6*, not 127 [Alex Jackson].
- Fixed input regression with Racin' Force, allowing it to boot again [Angelo Salese].
- Gave labels to many inputs in Midway's T, Wolf and Y Unit games as well as CPS1 and CPS3 [Joe Caporale].
- Implemented experimental HLSL post-processing support on Direct3D 9 targets [Ryan Holtz, Bat Country Entertainment]:
  * 5-pass post-processing: Upscale, Post-Process, Store Last Frame, Defocus 1, Defocus 2.
  * Many tunable effects including: Scanlines, defocus, linear deconvergence, radial deconvergence, pincushion, RGB colorspace convolution, YIQ colorspace convolution, saturation, simulated dot crawl, simulated chroma subsampling, aperture masking, and more.
  * Requires a GPU that supports Shader Model 3.0 to be enabled and a powerful GPU, the entire pipeline consists of approximately 30 texel fetches and approximately 230 arthimetic ops.
  * Will supersample the framebuffer up to 9x in both X and Y, but this requires an enormously powerful GPU that has not been invented; users with Radeon 5000-class cards should limit themselves to 3x, Radeon 4000 to 1.5x.
  * The default configuration will NOT appear to do anything; it requires tuning to the user's liking.
  * Should nicely fall back in all cases except missing shaders, and it might fall back correctly in that case as well. Report any anomalies.
  * For obvious reasons, the Direct3D8 renderer cannont support this.
- Enable Visual Studio basic run-time checks in non-optimized builds [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Flush stderr, so the data is actually written when output is being redirected [Oliver Stoneberg].
- i286: Added 286 LOADALL and triple fault resets [Carl].
- i286: Added support for 16-bit protected mode far calls and segmentprivilege checks [Carl]. 
- i86: Fixed shift instructions, helps detecting proper CPU [Miodrag Milanovic].
- i86: Fixed handling of invalid instructions in 0x60-0x6f section [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Major clean-up and state machine conversion for the Sega ST-V/Saturn driver [Angelo Salese].
- HLSL updates [Ryan Holtz, Bat Country Entertainment]:
  * Split color convolution and deconvergence into separate shaders for potential GPU savings down the line.
  * Added light and heavy variants of the color convolution shader, the former with YIQ colorspace removed.
  * Re-worked defocus to occur prior to shadow mask application, as it would be on a real monitor.
  * Split "pincushion" into "Pincushion" and "Screen Curvature", the former affecting the only the displayed image and the latter only affecting the shadow mask.
  * Made major fixes to CVBS simulation, significantly increasing color saturation.
  * Added magnet deconvergence via a shader uniform.
  * Improved phosphorescence.
  * Improved YIQ codec.
  * Added adjustable color carrier in YIQ processing mode. 
  * Fixed resolution-change crash and likely D3D performance regression with -nohlsl on low-spec cards.
  * Created a new OSD function, osd_get_slider_list, which allows OS-specific slider controls.
- HLSL Post-Processing updates [Ryan Holtz, Bat Country Entertainment, cgwg]:
  * The defocus pass is now switched off when defocus_x and defocus_y are zero, allowing finer-grained performance tuning.
  * Removed YIQ convolution from the main color-convolution shader and replaced it with a full composite encode/decode pass. This is slower, but looks amazing(ly like a terrible TV) and can be turned off.
  * More authentic NTSC dot crawl and bandwidth limiting.
- i86: Implemented POP CS and MOV CS,reg instructions that are 8086 specific [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Implemented multi-cart support to ST-V driver [Angelo Salese, Tafoid].
- Managed to get the multiplexer/state machine emulated, amongst some watchdog fixes for BFM games [J. Wallace].
- Added missing bipolar PROM dumps to Lucky Lady (Wing) [Team Europe].
- pic8259: Updated to be more according to documentation [Carl].
- Initial frameworking for upcoming artwork updates [Mr. Do].
