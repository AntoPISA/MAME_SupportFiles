Source changes:
---------------
- i386: xlat implementation fix [Alegend45].
- Fixed a sign bug with CVT.WS opcode in v810 CPU core [Angelo Salese].
- Updated netlist implementation [Couriersud]::
  * Now supports any resolution fitting reasonably into a UINT64
  * Execution now uses a list sorted by execution time.
  * Implementation now supports analog and digital inputs/outputs.
  * First step in a move to "terminals" being both input/output.
  * Improved object model.
  Pong:
  * Rewrote video code, now emulates a monitor by analyzing the analog video signal and identifying vsync and hysnc pulses.
  * Removed all hacks. Overall performance increase of about 10% over the previous "pongf" implementation.
- Patch that enables output of <info> elements stored in software lists through -listsoftware [qmc2].
- Flicker: Boots up, some buttons working. WIP [Robbbert].
- Continuing new device implementation for SN76496 and clones - mrdo.c, pachifev.c, tp84.c [Osso].
- Flicker: Added remaining inputs, some notes, sound (of sorts), marked as working [Robbbert].
- Implemented remaining BSU opcodes in V810 CPU core [Angelo Salese].
- Written up a bare-bones M50458 OSD video chip device, used by Nintendo Super System HW [Angelo Salese].
- Continuing new device implementation for SN76496 and clones [Osso].
- Written a preliminary S-3520CF RTC chip device, used by Nintendo Super System [Angelo Salese].
- zac_1: added display, inputs, notes. ewf and sshtlzac marked as working [Robbbert].
- Fixed G-Stream G2020's sound banking. Compared with a real PCB and everything sounds as it should [trap15].
- Added IGT ID-023 Protocol to driver. This additional DBV protocol allows all remaining unsupported sets to accept dollar bills in-game. The protocol is switchable via driver configuration (along with denomination) [Jim Stolis].
- Shared palette fix for certain sms-based games in Mega Tech [David Haywood].
- 20pacgal.c: Add PCB layout for 'Pacman - 25th Anniversary Edition' [Brian Troha].

- Fixed default SDL OSX UI toggle key name [Curt Coder].
- Added Swedish/Finnish SDL keymaps for OSX and Linux [Curt Coder].
- ppc: Implemented PPC403 DMA chaining [Ville Linde].
- Created new sprite device base class, which manages a bitmap and a sparse bitmap for tracking which areas got updated. This allows sprites to be rendered independently to their own bitmap and then mixed in a final step. Converted the Sega sprite device over to this new model, and moved the mixing steps out of the sprite implementations and into the driver- specific video updates where it belongs [Aaron Giles].
- Added some further methods and helpers to the bitmap_t and rectangle classes [Aaron Giles].
- Created a sega_16bit_common_base class which handles the common Sega palette RAM mappings and open bus reads [Aaron Giles].
- nwk-tr.c: Improved LAN controller emulation [Ville Linde].
- segaorun.c: Identified the Turbo Outrun "FD1094 317-unknown" set as 317-0106 and provided a working decryption key [Chris Hardy].
- Verified Dip Settings using Dip Sheet and through playtesting for deadconx, deadconxj [Tafoid].
- PowerPC: Fixed 601-type BAT processing [R. Belmont].
- taito_x.c: Corrected the ROM names for the Superman sets. Added info about an alternate ROM layout using a daughter card and half sized mask roms. Changed 'Gigandes (Japan)' to 'Gigandes (earlier)' as both sets support English/Japanese via dipswitch. But one set has a revised and corrected service mode [Brian Troha, Dave France, The Dumping Union].
- Improved SPC700 cycle opcode timings [Angelo Salese, byuu].
- Fixed a major bug with 5A22 timings, that was incorrectly taking extra steals at every read, write and rmw types of opcode [Angelo Salese].
- Moved multiplication and division operation from SNES to 5A22 CPU core file [Angelo Salese].
- Updated looping.c to use the new tms52xx device implementation [Osso].
- Made core able to use bios selection per slot device [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Made S1410 device act as a SCSIHD with the custom commands, added D9060HD & ACB4070 devices to do the same thing [smf].
- Numerous jedutil tool improvements [Kevin Eshbach]:
  * Made some modifications to the jedutil tool to allow the viewing of simple combinatorial jeds (adding support for registered and gals in the future) by taking a jed file and printing out human-readable equations. Changed the command line options of the jedutil tool to know take an initial argument to specify what the tool should do.
  * For example to convert a jed to bin the command is now: jedutil
 –convert <source.jed> <dest.bin> jedutil –convert <source.bin> <dest.jed>.
  * To view a jed file with human-readable equations the command is jedutil –view <source.jed> <pal type>.
- gfx_element is now a class. Accessors are provided for all necessary elements. Updated some of the more, ah, creative uses/abuses of the gfx_elements [Aaron Giles].
- Split out callbacks from scsibus_device into scscb_device, eventually this will be a SCSI device. SCSIBus_interface is no longer required and has been removed [smf].
- DRC: Give C backend x86/x64 shift=0 behavior for consistency [R. Belmont].
- PowerPC: 100% pass of integer portion of PPCTorture on all DRC backends [R. Belmont].
- es5503: Preserve phase when oscillators loop [R. Belmont].
- nwk-tr.c: Fixed LAN controller issues in 'Thrill Drive' [Ville Linde].
- xforce: Fixed display [Robbbert].
- Promoted brickzn to playable state [Luca Elia]
  * Fixed gfx ROMs loading.
  * Fixed inputs in joystick version.
  * Alternate data decryption.
  * Fixed alternate opcode decryption ranges.
  * Palette encryption, banking and writes disable.
  * Work RAM disable 
  * Multiplexing of registers through protection.
  * Added cheat / debugging inputs.
- Understood how the Seibu COP collision detection really works, greatly improving Godzilla, Heated Barrel and SD Gundam RT gameplay [Angelo Salese, Smitdogg].
- Generalized the PLS100 into a PLA device of variable amounts of inputs/outputs/terms [Curt Coder].
- In device_state_interface, rename state() to state_int() and set_state() to set_state_int() for consistency. Update all callers. Also add set_pc() helper and updated all callers to use that instead of set_state_int(STATE_GENPC) [Aaron Giles].
- Added device_t::state() method to get the state interface. Added redundant device_state_interface::state() method to catch redundant use of it [Aaron Giles].
- segac2.c: Corrected the ROM names for 'ThunderForce AC' [Arzeno Fabrice].
- Removed cpu_get_reg() and cpu_set_reg() macros in favor of using the above methods [Aaron Giles].
- Add ambiguous execute() and memory() methods to the device_execute/memory_interfaces respectively in order to catch unnecessary usage of the corresponding device_t methods. Removed all existing redundant usage [Aaron Giles].
- merit.c: Added dipswitches to the 'Pit Boss' sets with dipswitch locations. Reordered sets from oldest to newest. Added GAME_NO_COCKTAIL flag as these games support a cocktail mode. Mapped player 2 controls for cocktail mode [Brian Troha].
- Closeout on old macros. Retired cputag_set_input_line and cputag_set_input_line_and_vector, replacing them with machine.device("tag")->execute().set_input_line[_and_vector] [Aaron Giles].

- Rotation: Fixed displays, fixed sensors so that the game is now playable [Robbbert].
- es5503: Fix IRQ timing error introduced when I did the device conversion [R. Belmont].
- Made accurate trigonometry maths in Seibu COP [Angelo Salese, Smitdogg].
- Rewrote the SAA5050 Teletext character generator. Removed saa505x.c which was used by bbc.c, and refactored all drivers to use the new implementation [Curt Coder].
- idetrl.c: Support IDE command 0x31 (IDE_COMMAND_WRITE_MULTIPLE_NORETRY) [Phil Bennett].
- splash.c: Changed the Machine Config to use actual OSC values and measured clocks as listed in the driver. Added a note about a Splash PCB with alternate (higher) OSC clocks. Added a note about The Return of Lady Frog 9 ROM and the 1 bit difference between the two sets [Brian Troha].
- Fixes so MESS on PowerPC OS X builds and works again. MAME is still lost cause [R. Belmont].
- Updated DOCS config.txt and windows.txt with recent commands that were never added to documentation as well as some clarifications [Tafoid].
