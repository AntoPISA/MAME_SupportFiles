xxx


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Accurate colors in 'Eggs' [Gerald Vanderick].
- Accurate colors in 'Warp Warp' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Accurate colors in 'Wonder Boy Deluxe', 'Up'n Down' and 'Pitfall II' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Accurate colors in 'Zoar' [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Some fixes to the System 16 games [Phil Stroffolino].
- Fixed colors in 'Paperboy' [Aaron Giles].
- Some fiddling with the Atari vector games frame rates [Nicola Salmoria].
- Slightly reduced the visible area of the Williams games, I'm not sure which would be the correct setting though [Nicola Salmoria].
- Better colors in 'Red Alert' [Mike Balfour].


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------
- Sped up music tempo in 'Gun Dealer' [Nicola Salmoria].
- 'Wizard of Wor' supports word samples. Only 30% of the needed samples are available, however [Alex Judd].
- Fixed 'D-Day' [Zsolt Vasvari].


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------
- Fixed 'Black Tiger', 'Bank Panic' and 'The End' [Nicola Salmoria].
- 'World Cup '90' [Juan Carlos Lorente].


Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- Support for the complete 'Curveball' set. This also fixes the crash [Nicola Salmoria].
- Many improvements to the DECO games, especially Heavy Barrel [Bryan McPhail].
- Sped up 'Route 16' [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Lots of clean up, consolidation, dip switches additions, color fixes to the 'Carnival' driver (which is now called vicdual.c, since Carnival is just one of the many games which run on that hardware) [Marco Cassili].
- Slowed down a little the Sega raster games.
- You can assign a joystick button to the gear shift in 'Spy Hunter'.
- Red Alert accepts coins [Mike Balfour].


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------
- Increased the default gamma correction for the DOS version to 1.2. This will not have effect unless you change it in MAME.CFG (or just delete the file) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Set back the default vgafreq to -1 (=auto). This is necessary for -vsync to pick the correct freq (most of the time) when used with tweaked VGA modes. This will not have effect unless you change it in MAME.CFG (or just delete the file) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed crash in -verifyroms which occurred in beta 3 [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed -ror and -rol with ORIENTATION_SWAP_XY games (e.g. 'Kick') and ORIENTATION_FLIP_X games (e.g. 'Discs of Tron') [Nicola Salmoria].
- In the DOS version, -vsync is supported for games running at 57fps (e.g. 'Moon Patrol'). However, due to the sync rate being different, the game runs 6% faster than it should [Nicola Salmoria].


Source changes:
---------------
- The DOS version is now compiled with GCC 2.8.1 [Nicola Salmoria].
- T11 CPU emulator. This is used by the Atari System 2 drivers [Aaron Giles].
- I8085 emulator [Juergen Buchmueller].
- The 68000 memory handlers can again be word-aligned instead of longword-aligned [Aaron Giles].
- Dynamic palette support for games with >256 colors, not complete yet but good for many cases. Drivers who want to use it must first of all set up like the static palette ones (put the real number of colors in MachineDriver-> total_colors, etc.), and call palette_recalc() in vh_screenrefresh() before drawing anything. A color uage table must be passed to palette_recalc() so that the function knows which colors are needed. Drivers which use the new system, and therefore no longer run in 16-bit video modes: 'Black Tiger', 'City Connection', 'Gun Dealer', 'Ninja Gai Den' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Color PROMs no longer have to be included in the source. They can be loaded from disk just like the other ROMs. You just have to replace the color_prom pointer with the PROM_MEMORY_REGION() macro, to tell the core where the PROMs have been loaded. Example driver: 'Karnov'/'Chelnov' [Nicola Salmoria].
