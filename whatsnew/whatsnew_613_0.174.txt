Source changes:
---------------
-chdman.cpp: fix for code that expects to be able to dereference a pointer that it knows may be null [Vas Crabb].
-redumped Atomiswave BIOS, confirmed good, added information [Brizzo, MetalliC].
-screen: Add svg shapes pre-computation [Olivier Galibert].
-plugins/layout: layout embedded script helper plugin [Carl].
-h8: Add dtc, dma, watchdog (WIP) [Olivier Galibert].

-a5200: fixed regression when loading headerless carts from fullpath [Fabio Priuli].
-neogeo.cpp: huge clean up of the cartslot code in order to better 
 exploit slot devices: [Fabio Priuli]
  * Moved cart-specific components to the carts itself removing the fake protection devices from the main system, since they never belonged there.
  * Removed hacky ROM region destruction/construction when a new cart is inserted, replacing it with proper bank pointers to the carts (except for ymsnd and ymsnd.deltat region which will require modernization of the ym devices).
  * Started re-organization of bootleg boards emulation, so to reduce the need of collapsing everything into a single cart type with multiple protection devices, more work is needed.
- neopcb.cpp: moved to a separate source file the emulation for JAMMA PCB versions of a few neogeo games, since they don't have a cartslot[Fabio Priuli]

 to the software list and aligned the list to the driver. [Fabio Priuli]
