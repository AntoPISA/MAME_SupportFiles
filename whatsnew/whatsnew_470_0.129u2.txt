Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed compilation errors if HAS_SAMPLES is 0 [Nathan Woods].
- Stop crash/assert when trying to decrease the debugger memory window bytes per line to 0 [Phil Bennett].
- Improved implementations for undocumented instructions 63, 67, 6f, 73, 77, 7b, 7f, 9c, 9e, ab, e3, e7, ef, f3, f7, fb, and ff in the n2a3 CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- Force recalculation of screen parameters when only the MC6845 input clock changes [Wilbert Pol].
- Seibu CRTC part 1 [Angelo Salese]:
  * Merged Sengoku Mahjong & Good e Jong video HWs.
  * Added correct scrolling functions for 'Sengoku Mahjong'.
  * Removed some positioning kludges in both drivers.
- Fixed 'Sengoku Mahjong' hopper error after first winning match [Angelo Salese].
- Removed deprecat dependancy from Good e Jong, one irq wasn't needed at all (points to a reti) [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed CPU reset for upd78c06. [Wilbert Pol].
- Added new #define ENDIANNESS_NATIVE, which maps to either ENDIANNESS_LITTLE or ENDIANNESS_BIG based on the LSB_FIRST definition. Unlink LSB_FIRST, ENDIANNESS_NATIVE always exists and can be used in expressions without invoking the preprocessor [Aaron Giles].
- Added macro ENDIAN_VALUE_LE_BE() which selects one of two values based on the endianness passed in. Also added NATIVE_ENDIAN_VALUE_LE_BE() which calls ENDIAN_VALUE_LE_BE with ENDIANNESS_NATIVE [Aaron Giles].
- Updated a number of drivers and call sites to use these macros in favor of #ifdef LSB_FIRST [Aaron Giles].
- Removed some stray ADDR2BYTE/BYTE2ADDR macros that have been replaced by inline functions [Aaron Giles].
- DRC frontends must now do their own opcode fetching unfortunately [Aaron Giles].
- Updated all DRC cores to do this. Also tweaked a few oddities in the SH2 DRC [Aaron Giles].
- drw80pkr changes [Jim Stolis]:
  * Added bankswitching to program memory.
  * Partial graphics support.
  * Partial sound support.
- Preliminary ADPCM hook-up to Jantotsu, it plays something but it's not yet right [Angelo Salese].
- Removed redundant config parameter from SND_START [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed GFX regression with 18 Holes Pro Golf and added proper memory map for the second CPU [Angelo Salese].
- Sound cores no longer allocate their own tokens. Instead they return a new integer value indicating the size of token they want, and the core allocates it for them. This mirrors the standard device behavior [Aaron Giles].
- SRMP5 update: Sound pitch is low with current st0016 driver [tsBTN0640].
- Fixed Perfect Soldiers input (added missing button3) [a3SEybxT0].
- Added missing key for sfiiij and sfiii2j [swzp1Dp/0].
- Tidied up the micro3d driver and fixed sound [Phil Bennett].
- Increased Cloak & Dagger interleave quantum to eliminate 'SLAVE COM BAD' startup message [Phil Bennett].
- Major cleanup to IGS poker games [Mirko Buffoni]:
  * Renamed csk driver to igspoker. This includes Champion Poker, Champion Skill and New Champion Skill.
  * Converted drivers to tilemap system and unified video section
  * Unified memory maps and checked all input ports.
  * Removed obsolete palette handlers and made use of generic handlers.
  * Added layout for lamps handling.
  * Added hopper simulation.
  * Added New Champion Skill (different set, maybe original international release) and renamed current igs_ncs to igs_ncs2 (2000 version for italian market).
  * Promoted igs_ncs2 to working state, but set GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS (missing initial notice screen).
  * Moved Jackie to a separate driver (it's a slot machine game)
  * Made some progress on Jackie which now boots (toggle mode to play, but work still needs to be done).
- Virtual Combat and Shadow Fighters update [Phil Bennett]:
  * Fixed framebuffer handling & screen parameters.
  * Added sound.
  * Corrected RAM sizes to match what is present on the PCBs.
  * Hooked up NVRAM.
- Fixed clamping to 12 bit range to Okim6376, and adjusted volume attenuation accordingly [Mirko Buffoni].
- Fixed TMS5220 speech in Turbo Sub [Phil Bennett, Jay Gallagher].
- ADP improvements: Implemented p1 inputs in skattv and fashiong (service mode is working) [robiza].
- Defined ROM_LOAD64_WORD/ROM_LOAD64_WORD_SWAP in emu/romload.h [Phil Bennett].
- cb2001: mapped two more opcodes [robiza].
- Fixed Soul Calibur (vs. Inferno) [4oj9/xJ+0] 
- Added custom 3-screen layout to Stepping Stage driver [Naibo Zhang].
- Changed yunsung8 oki xtal to 400khz, verified on PCB. Unfortunately I couldn't verify the main xtal which was missing on my PCB [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Restored previous cycle eating behavior in gstream [Mamesick].
- Changed device start routines to no longer return a status. Instead, if a device needs to delay its initialization pending the startup of another device, it must call the new function device_delay_init() [Olivier Galibert].
