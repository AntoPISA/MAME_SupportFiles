     many samples to be loaded in low resolution video modes
  * On the CoCo, this fixes some low resolution video modes used by
     Project Nebula and some other games

-CoCo 1/2: Fixed configurable RAM sizes [Nathan Woods]:
  * Changes the 6883 SAM implementation to assume memory bank lengths

     images and softlist items

 (this is just better error checking) [Nathan Woods].

 image unless device_image_interface::create() is used.  This fixes odd
 behavior where zero byte images could be created [Nathan Woods].

 [Nathan Woods]

 [shattered]

-dvk_ksm: Dropped dvk_ksm01 variant and merged ROM sets; enabled tx to
 its keyboard [shattered].

 [shattered]

-dynax.cpp: Regularized service inputs [AJR].

-Attempted to fix distortion with -refreshspeed and -audio xaudio2.
 [Calamity]

-New stretching options (as suggested by Jezze): [Calamity]
  * New option -unevenstretchy (complementary to -unevenstretchx)
  * New option -autostretchxy, to automatically apply -unevenstretchx
     or -unevenstretchy based on source native orientation.

-Warp mode for relative mouse on OSX SDL 2.0.4 (fixes Github issue
 #1232). [bradhugh]

-sengokmj: Inputs refined based on examination of program code [AJR]:
  *  All service inputs are momentary switches, not DIP toggles
  *  Added unused SW2 DIPs as displayed in service mode
  *  Added a couple of obscure inputs not shown in service mode

-pwrkick, othldrby: Various improvements [AJR]:

     mechanism for the latter
  * Added ticket dispenser to Power Kick (seems to work for the most part)
  * Removed numerous bogus DIP switches
  * Thoroughly reconfigured coin inputs in Power Kick, adding counters
     and lockouts for all three (including the "Key In" input that
     really isn't)

  * For indirect pens, index of the corresponding color is also shown
  * For colors in normal RAM-based palettes, the raw value in memory is
     also shown (does not currently work with most buffered palettes,
     and is incompatible with PROM-based or RAMDAC-based palettes)

-Validity checking improvements [AJR]:
  * Always print the name of each driver with -validate -verbose before
     check to help detect crashes

      mask
