Source changes:
---------------
- Abstracted the notion of outputs. A new module, output.c, now controls all outputs. Each output is tagged with a name; some standardization eventually needs to happen on these names, but at the moment it's fully open. The OSD layer can register with output.c to be notified when outputs change. From there, it is free to do what it wants. LEDs have now been converted to outputs with the name "led0", "led1", etc [Aaron Giles].
- Added new functions that do accurate per-screen timing based on video parameters [Aaron Giles]:

  video_screen_get_hpos
  video_screen_get_vpos
  video_screen_get_hblank
  video_screen_get_vblank
  video_screen_get_time_until_pos

- Added built-in layouts for 'Turbo', 'Subroc 3D', 'Buck Rogers', 'Atari Football', 'Atari Baseball', and 'Super Speed Racer' using the new primitives [Aaron Giles].
- Added built-in overlays for clowns and maze [Mr. Do!].
- Added new layout element component type "led7seg", which constructs a 7-segment LED in an element in a layout. This is commonly used for external score and timer displays. See maxaflex.c for an example [Aaron Giles].
- Added new layout element component type "text", which lets you draw text in the built-in MAME font onto an element in a layout. This can be used for basic lamps and built-in layouts. See maxaflex.c for an example [Aaron Giles].
- Added new render target layer config flag to disable screen overlays [Aaron Giles].
- Added support for notifying external clients of changes in output states in the Windows OSD system. See windows/output.h for a list of messages that external clients can register to receive. Removed the built-in hacky LED support in the Windows OSD layer. Created a sample application ledutil.exe which subscribes to the external events and routes the "led0", "led1", and "led2" outputs to the keyboard LEDs just like before. If you want to continue to have LED support, simply copy ledutil.exe into your startup folder and let it run in the background [Aaron Giles].
- Changed render_target_alloc() to take a bitmask of flags. In addition to loading a single file, targets can also be marked "hidden", and only non-artwork views can be made visible [Aaron Giles].
- Changed snapshot taking code to render the particular screen to a temporary render target. This allows vector games to have snapshots again [Aaron Giles].
- Converted 'Final Romance 2' to be dual screen [David Haywood].
- Converted the VFD display in the BFM games to use a second screen rather than hacking onto the main screen [El Condor].
- Fixed bug that caused the VIDEO_EOF to be called repeatedly while in the debugger [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed detection of left/right modifier keys when paused. Also added support for recently added keys so they are detected by MAME when paused [Ben Rudiak-Gould].
- Fixed overflow computation in the S2650 core [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed the dips for 'Apache 3' and 'Dark Mist' [Brian Troha].
- Modified the Q*Bert driver to signal a "knocker0" output when the knocker is triggered [Aaron Giles].
- More Sega G-80 raster cleanup [Aaron Giles]:
  * Consolidated the video hardware implementations.
  * Fixed cocktail mode video and controls in all games.
  * Fixed 'Monster Bash' (2 board version) video.
  * Revived 'Sindbad Mystery' and fixed sound chip frequencies.
- Normalized the naming of several functions in video.c, most importantly [Aaron Giles]:

  force_partial_update -> video_screen_update_partial
  configure_screen -> video_screen_configure
  set_visible_area -> video_screen_set_visarea

- Split render.c into rendutil.c, rendlay.c, and render.c to keep the code more organized [Aaron Giles].
