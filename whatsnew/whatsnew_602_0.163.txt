Source changes:
---------------
- c64: Added an SX-64 variant called Tesa Etikettendrucker 6240 [Retroport].
-Changed vignetting simulation [ImJezze]
 * Removed screen ratio influence
 * Changed radius, blur and intensity
 * Fixed roundness of rounded corners; the default aspect ratio of 4:3 should not be stretched anymore when the source has another ratio.
 * Disabled blurring of rounded corners.
 * Some cleanup.
 * Something was messed up on the last commit.

-mips3: Make fast RAM handling faster by caching certain values. [MooglyGuy]

-Introduced user definable truth tables:
 This enables the addition of devices without changing the netlist 
 source code and allows the creation of libraries. Used pong.c as a
 proof of concept for the time being [Couriersud].

-chsuper.c driver: Reworked all inputs and implemented full outputs
 from the scratch. Added DIP switches, DIP locations, extra input port
 present in the test mode, implemented coin counters and hopper out /
 ticket out signals, implemented full set of lamps and workaround for
 the possible Hold3 lamp line circuitry. Also added a nice control
 panel internal layout. Documented all ports properly and added some
 findings. Changed the CPU clock to 3 MHz to get the game more
 playable. Need to check against a real PCB [Roberto Fresca].

-Champion Super 2 & 3 games: Improved the internal layout to represent
 a realistic control panel, with clickable button-lamps and a coin in.
 Also added the missing BET MAX function to the HOLD 1 input/button.
 [Roberto Fresca]

-Add configurable clock dividers for Namco C352 [superctr]

-Added gradius3js - split ROM version of Japanese S set Corrected ROM
 names in madmotor as per dumped board with matching checksums Added
 two new versions of Turtle Ship [system11b]

-idehd.c: increase IDE fill-time to avoid missed interrupts [Peter Ferrie]

-Allow compiling with shared libraries [Olivier Galibert]
 Put SHLIB=1 in the main makefile, or on the command line.

-mac: fix crashiness in NuBus "image" card host access [R. Belmont]

-delegate.h now supports mingw 32 bit builds with INTERNAL
 configuration. Member functions are called in this case using
 __thiscall ABI [Couriersud].

-mac: Image card now accepts paths starting with '$' for your $HOME
 needs.  Also fixed a crash if the path is invalid [R. Belmont].

-Fix Game Blaster emulation, now working [balrog]

-Fix game blaster compatibility in sb1.0 [balrog]

-gameboy.c: improved accuracy of the emulation for MBC2 games [Tauwasser]

-ui: when accessing the internal File Manager for a system with
 available softlists, let the softlist item be highlighted by default
 to make navigation faster [Fabio Priuli]

-cheat: improved cheat support for games in softlist. XML cheats for
 home systems should now be stored in a subfolder (or a compressed
 archive), named after the software list, inside the cheatpath. this
 allows for loading cheats for consoles / home computers without
 interfering with arcade cheats when games have identical shortnames.
 For instance, loading Galaga in NES allows now to use its specific
 cheats even if a galaga.xml is available in the arcade cheat.7z
 (previously you'd get an error due to the arcade cheat referring to a
 cpu not present in the NES). [Pugsy, Fabio Priuli]

-n64.xml: fixed some parent/clone relation. [Andrea Petrucci]

-audit.c: fixed a crash occurring when trying to mount a CHD from the
 internal UI. [Fabio Priuli]

-Solved the great Sherwood Forest mystery.  DOS 3.3 inserts a short
 (3-4 cycles, roughly equivalent to one bit) delay between writing the
 header and the data bytes in the sector data block. 
 [Peter Ferrie, Olivier Galibert, Richter Belmont]

-Fixed superbug explosion overlay. [SoltanGris42, Couriersud]

-Changed the way NETLIST_START(NAME) is located and called. This is
 done now solely by using a netlist_sources_t class. Netlist users just
 register sources like memregions, hardcoded strings, compiled
 netlists. Going forward this enables to eventually put macro model
 librariers into roms. The improvement comes with a price. Compiled
 netlists to be included must now be registered using LOCAL_SOURCE.
 [Couriersud]

-fixed .lst files whitespace problem [LnmVolbo]

-galaxian.c: Correct ROM labels for the Stern Electronics license of
 The End. [caius]

-mos6526: Fixed port A/B read. [geecab]

-Improve Ensoniq 5503DOC Swap Mode [NJRoadfan]

-Gameshark is a clone of Action Replay [Andrea Petrucci]

-Fixed a number of bugs
 * proxy savestates
 * solver savestates
 * 7490 both counts firing at the same time bug fix. and changed timed
   list to be resizable [Couriersud].

-floppy: Ensure that get_next_transition always provide the next
 transition [Olivier Galibert]

-Added missing video board PAL for xevious and clones.  [caius]

-Added OPT_FLAGS back [Belegdol]

-naomi.c: full dump of "Samba De Amigo" prototype [Arzeno Fabrice, MetalliC, rtw]

-Added kidniki sound board netlist to nl_examples. Currently the
 netlist boils down to a 87x87 matrix. This is due to a total of 6
 opamps which all are submodels and thus add their own internal nets.
 Gauss Seidel iterative solving comes to it's limits. nltool runs this
 at about 50% speed on my machine. Given the complexity this is quite
 good. Yet, any m62 game currently will not be playable. Time for a new
 cpu :-) [Andrew Gardner, Couriersud]

-m20: improve keyboard [Carl]

-Added the ability to use system flac, jpeg, lua, sqlite3, portmidi and
 zlib based on wallyweek's work This brings the system lib capabilities
 back to where they were prior to build system rewrite [Julian Sikorski]

-Added new SDL_INI_PATH flag [Cesare Falco]

-Model1 Communication Board [Ariane Fugmann]
 * add emulator options required for comm boards
 * add the model 1 communication board as a device
 * add an optional simulation for the model 1 communication (enabled
    atm.)
 * allows to play Virtua Racing, Virtua Formula and WingWar in "link mode".

-victor9k: Fixed keyboard [Curt Coder].

-gamegear: allow master gear adapter to see lightphaser offsets.
 [Enik Land]

-rohga.c: Redumped MAS10 sound sample ROM at the correct size.  Fixes
 missing sounds in the Darkseal 2. [Porchy, The Dumping Union]

-From 45% to 60% to 99%. That's the improvement achieved for a 89x89
 audio matrix mostly solved by elimination. Cleaned up some code as
 well [Couriersud].

-seta, x1-010: Fix pitch in downtown [superctr]

-Added a GMRES solver to netlist. The generalized minimal residual
 method ist certainly more modern than Gaussian elimination and
 Gauss-Seidel. However, more the current maximum matrix (KidNiki,
 89x89) a combination of Gauss-Seidel to solve for maximum one step to
 catch quasi-stable conditions and fall-back to optimized Gaussian
 elimination (for sparse matrix) outperforms GMRES by up to 100%.
 [Couriersud]

-tms5110r.c: Add new LPC table data for CD2802, CD2801;
 TMS5110A/TMC0281D; add new information regarding each chip. Reorganize
 LPC tables to use #defines rather than repeating identical data.
 [PlgDavid, Lord_Nightmare, NullMoogleCable]

-Netlist code now uses "namespace netlist". At the same time, moved all
 devices int netlist::devices namespace [Couriersud].

-GLSL: unlimit shader file size [R. Belmont].

-tms5110.c and tms5220.c: fix missing cast for chirp/excitation values,
 fix a potential off-by-one for tms5110.c as well [Lord Nightmare].

-info.c: worked around missing sub-devices in -lx output [Fabio Priuli]

-model3: various improvements [Ville Linde] 
  * Rewrote projection calculations to use projection matrix 
  * Rewrote polygon clipping to use 4D W-space clipping 
  * Implemented 8-bit texture uploads 
  * Changed all scanline renderers to use rgbutil

-naomi.c: brute forced DES key for "Shakatto Tambourine (GDS-0002B)"
 [CaH4e3, MetalliC, emuDrache (trurip), rtw]

-missing gamecube edition roms added [andrea-petrucci]

-uzebox: adding sound emulation [Felipe Sanches]

-chihiro.c: brute missing keys for Sega Network Taisen Mahjong MJ 2 and
 MJ 3 [f205v, MetalliC]

-Completely integrated the GMRES solver into netlist solver templates
 and recoded it from scratch. GMRES now runs at 122% (kidniki), that's
 a real improement from 60% before. AT the same time, the code should
 be easier to read and closer to the GMRES algorithm. Ultimately,
 kidniki will not use this solver but instead use some frontiers to
 keep it playable. But going forward, for larger matrices this solver
 is an opton [Couriersud].

-Made possible creation of custom builds with given list of drivers
 included. Note that game list is parsed so if macros are used they
 will not be found. example:  [Miodrag Milanovic]
 make SUBTARGET=cops -j9 DRIVERS=src/mame/drivers/cops.c

-Analog drums and filtering for Kid Niki et al. [Andrew Gardner, Couriersud]

- Properly emulate the double PCB stack system32 games with shared RAM
  bridge board (Air Rescue and F1 Exhaust Note)
  Previously these relied on a hack to make the code believe the 2nd
  stack was present but this caused issues, now they're correctly emulated
  as dual screen games without any hack [David Haywood].

- Support -uimodekey switch on Windows [Vas Crabb]

- apricot: use correct wd fdc type and fix floppy motor on, implement
graphics mode, simulate sio irq m1 access. successfully boots from disk
now.  [Dirk Best]

- apricot: add an expansion slot interface and add two RAM expansion
cards. this will also be usuable by the apricot f series and portable.
  [Dirk Best]
  
- apricot: add initial keyboard support  [Dirk Best]

- update all drivers to use the new wd floppy controller implementation
and remove the legacy one.  [Dirk Best]

- i8089: add wait for drq support.  [Dirk Best]

- wd_fdc: fixes for ZX-Spectrum and clones Beta128 disk interface [MetalliC]

- pentagon: cycle exact screen / border raster effects emulation [MetalliC]

- liberate:c:  Validated and consolidated dip switches for driver and added
locations  [Tafoid]

- suna8: Fixed sparkman player 2 colors and samples played from second rom.
  Removed spurious samples played on reset by most games [Luca Elia]

Added / completed /enabled save state support to the following drivers:
battlera.c, cclimber.c, gaplus.c, grchamp.c, namcos1.c, nbmj8991.c, shisen.c,
snk68.c, spacefb.c, sprcros2.c, srmp5.c, vastar.c, warpwarp.c [Osso]

- rgbutil: Converted to class and added more functions. [MooglyGuy]

- n64: Converted RDP rendering to use SSE2 when available. [MooglyGuy]

- Fixed text layer colours in 'The Battle Road' after PCB verification,
  unflagged and removed comment saying it is guessed [David Haywood, caius]

- xt_hdc: improved PIO use.  [Barry Rodewald]

- amstrad: added support for the Dobbertin HD20 hard disk.  [Barry Rodewald]
