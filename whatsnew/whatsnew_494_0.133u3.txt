Source changes:
---------------
- Added a lot of new clones to multfish and cleaned up the driver [Vampirz, Fabio Priuli, Brian Troha].
- Further ROM name fixes and driver name changes [Yasuhiro Ogawa]:
  * Renamed (digdugb) to (digdug1) - it's a rev1, not a bootleg.
  * Renamed (digduga1) to (digdugat1).
- SNES Updates [Angelo Salese]:
  * Fixed direct color gfxs in mode 7.
  * Fixed direct color gfxs in mode 3/4.
  * Fixed a vram out-of-bounds bug.
  * Fixed a blending bug involving main/sub color maths.
  * Fixed interlace mode gfxs when not in gfx modes 5/6.
  * Fixed a GDMA boundary bug.
  * Made the OAM address reset more accurate.
  * Fixed HDMA mid-frame inits.
  * Added clip colors to black window function.
  * Converted color clipping to use struct entries.
  * Made dynamic H resolutions to be called only at vblank start and and fixed gfx mode switching 1/5 and 5/1.
  * Made the gfx mode switches more accurate.
  * Corrected a bunch of SPC registers behaviour.
  * Improved joypad read/write handling and fixed a serial port quirk.
  * Fixed serial port for player 2 as well.
  * Improved cart mode 20 reserved access behaviour.
  * Added OBJ interlace support.
- ST-V: Improved timer 1 irq behaviour. Pebble Beach still have issues with gameplay start though (writes lots of garbage for whatever reason, really worked for random chances before) [Angelo Salese].
- Corrected name from Devil's Island to Devil Island. Filled in year for Fruit Bonus 2006 SE & Bug Fever [Brian Troha].
- Discrete sound update [Couriersud]:
  * Removed global variable discrete_current_context.
  * Discrete_info is now passed instead of device, we may get device by using disc_info->device.
  * Added DISCRETE_IMPORT(*block): imports another discrete block.
  * Added DISCRETE_REMOVE(node1, node2): removes a range of nodes.
  * Added DISCRETE_REPLACE: next node replaces existing node, thus preserving run order.
  * Added DISCRETE_NOP(node): does nothing, to be replaced.
  * Added a prescanning stage to build final block list after execution of the above.
  * The additions provide an easy way to document subtle difference between boards. 
  * Please see audio/galaxian.c for an example.
- Galaxian sound updates [Couriersud]:
  * Moon Cresta and Galaxian now have their respective schematics emulated, i.e. Moon Cresta has a slightly different mixing stage.
  * Cleaned up driver, added some section titles and comments, removed old code.
  * Removed emu_timer, this was causing a stream of stream_updates only updating 3 samples.
  * Replaced with discrete timer module DSS_TIMER now.
  * Use DISCRETE_NOTE for pitch generation; it is more accurate (within the one ms where the pitch changes :-) ) and saves a node.
  * Use DISCRETE_BITS_DECODE and save 2 nodes.
- YM2612/3834 updates [Eke-Eke, Nemesis]:
  * Split YM2612/3834 to a separate file to avoid disturbing other OPN chips.
  * SSG-EG, envelope, LFO, and CSM behavior all improved to better match tested behavior on real YM2612 chips.
- DSS_COUNTER updates [Couriersud]:
  * Clock_node no longer needs to be static for DISC_CLK_IS_FREQ.
  * Rewrote inc/dec logic to avoid loop.
- Added DISCRETE_BIT(S)_DECODE [Couriersud]:
  * Decodes individual bits from input values.
  * Updated drivers which had macro DISCRETE_BITSET (which was a bit misleading).
  * This should be slightly faster than using DISCRETE_TRANSROM.
- Discrete sound enhancements [Couriersud]:
  * Put some life into RCDISC5 enable mode. This now acts as a switch between R and C. Capacitor voltage will be preserved if disabled.
  * Made galaxian use the above. Saved 2 nodes and increased accuracy.
  * Added DISC_LFSR_FLAG_OUTPUT_SR_SN1 flag to shift register noise generator. This will output the value of the shift register to sub-node 1. This is needed for future bzone discrete sound emulation. BTW: RCDISC5 will be used as well. 
  * Left a note on RCDISC3 on what is needed to be implemented for bzone.
  * Optimized the LFSR a bit. LFSRs running at high frequency (> sample_freq) should benefit.
- Verified and fixed deniam.c M68K, Z80, YM3812 and OKIM6295 clocks and OKI pin 7 for logic pro and logic pro 2.  Fixed visible area on logic pro and logic pro 2 to match real PCBs. Add comment about what ym3812 clone is used. Add note about missing graphical effect in logic pro (screen dim on coin insert) and marked as IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS. Add note about 4 pixels at left edge of screen [Charles MacDonald, Lord Nightmare].
- Attempt to define an I64FMT string that can be used for printf'ing 64-bit integers. This is defined to be "I64" on MSVC and recent mingw compilers, and "ll" for all others. Updated all instances of 64-bit prints to use the new macro [Aaron Giles].
- Added spacwalk extended time setting and DIP locations [gregf, hap].
- Merged 5110intf into tms5110, and 5220intf into tms5220 [Aaron Giles].
- Z80 changes [hap]:
  * Fixed X/Y flags in CCF/SCF/BIT, ZEXALL is happy now.
  * Simplified DAA, renamed MEMPTR (3.8) to WZ (same temp register as the officially named WZ in the 8080), added TODO.
- 8085 changes [hap]:
  * Fixed cycle deduction on unconditional CALL / RET, it took about half too many cycles.
  * Added cycle tables and cleaned up source layout. This was done very carefully, it should be errorfree.
  * Removed HLT cycle eating (earlier, HLT after EI could theoretically fail).
  * Fixed parity flag on add/sub/cmp. Bug was caused by z80 overflow detection accidentally left in.
  * Renamed temp register XX to official name WZ.
  * Renamed flags from Z80 style S Z Y H X V N C  to  S Z X5 H X3 P V C and fixed X5 / V flags where accidentally broken due to flag names confusion.
- Fixed MSVC 64-bit compile errors [Aaron Giles].
- Added rgb[a]int_sh[l|r] operations to the rgbutils. rgbvmx needs to be updated. Nobody is using them yet [Aaron Giles].
- Added color PROM for Triple Draw Poker [David Haywood].
- Changed profiler to separate start/stop cases [Christophe Jaillet].
- taito_z DIPSW fixes [kanikani].
- Added decryption key for Extreme Hunting 2 [Andreas Naive].
- Naomi update [R. Belmont, Deunan Knute, Alex, Mr. Mudkips, Frank Bukor]:
  * Use new dump for ic31/32, ROM board test passes now.
  * Add protection hookup for Marvel vs. Capcom 2, game is playable w/sound.
- Added support TMS1000 family models TMS1000/1070/1100/1200/1270/1300. Added support for configuration of output PLA to the tms0980/tms1000 interface [Wilbert Pol].
- Implemented transparent mode access for some 6845 model sy6845 [Roberto Lavarone] 
- Verified clocks + Vsyncs on Downtown, Caliber 50 and Xmen (2-4 players) [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Changed to mono both Downtown and Caliber 50: these pcbs don't have a stereo connector  [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Verified and added correct xtals values for cps1 boards. Added correct xtal and divisor for OKI6295 taken from Forgotten Worlds schematics [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Decrypted several tables from the B-Rap Boys ROM [David Haywood].
