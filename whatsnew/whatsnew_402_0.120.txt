Nightmare in the Dark (bootleg) [Johnboy]
World Heroes (set 3) [Johnboy]
World Heroes 2 Jet (set 2) [Johnboy]


Source changes:
---------------
- Added "native" architecture option to the makefile. Use this to have gcc automatically pick the most appropriate architecture based on the system that it is compiling on [Christophe Jaillet].
- Hooked up the KL5C80 communications CPU to the HNG64 BIOS and emulated some of its features [Andrew Gardner, Justin Kerk].
- Fixed a few pointer truncation bugs in the Windows 64-bit code. Enabled warnings for 64-bit pointer truncations. Merged the x86 and x64 manifests [Atari Ace].
- Changed 6821 PIA logging so that it only logs core messages once [Tim Lindner].
- Updates to various NeoGeo ROMsets. Some ROM names updated to match verified names from chip labels. A lot of "older" sets have been  redumped to investigate the "64k m1/s1 issue" (also the m1 "overdumps"). Result was, ALL m1 ARE at least 128kx8; ALL s1 ARE 128kx8. The old m1 "overdumps" were incomplete dumps. In addition, it has been discovered that all "p-roms" do have a minimum size of 4mbit. A number of sets have been restored to their "original" state, and a number of others have been marked as bad dumps where appropriate.
- Specific changes include [Johnboy]:
  * bjourney: Readded 128k m1 from Mame v0.34b5.

  * nam1975: Fully redumped, added correct m1/s1.
  * ncombata: Fully redumped, renamed set to ncombath.
  * neomrdo: Readded 128k s1 from Mame v0.34b5.

  * svc: Removed MVS tag, only one version exists (AES/MVS/PCB).
  * svcboot: Removed MVS tag.
  * tws96: Readded 128k m1 from Mame v0.34b5.
  * viewpoin: Readded 128k m1/s1 from Mame v0.34b5.
  * wh1h: Fully redumped, is verified AES version.
  * wh1ha: Renamed from wh1h to wh1ha.
  * wh2j: Fully redumped, is verified MVS version.
  * wh2j: Partially redumped, renamed to wh2jh, is verified AES version.
- Made several more traditional optimizations to the voodoo emulations, gaining a few percent improvement [Aaron Giles].
- Further tweaked the work code to appropriately check for work items versus checking for the number of outstanding items [Aaron Giles].
- Simplified some of the model2 rendering code [Aaron Giles].
- Moved a number of files from mame/machine and mame/video to emu/machine and emu/video. In general, files that emulate a common industry standard chip (as opposed to custom, manufacturer-specific chips) were moved. Further moves may happen in the future to isolate common system-level components (such as amiga, snes, etc.) [Aaron Giles, Curt Coder].
