Source changes:
----------------
- Improvements to Seibu SPI decryption. Tile graphics are decrypted for all Games Sprites decrypted for Raiden Fighters 2000 [Nicola Salmoria].
- Discrete sound in Tank 8 [Hans Andersson].
- Added trackballs in Championship Bowling [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed Super Trio sound frequency [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- FD1089 update [Nicola Salmoria, Charles MacDonald].
- Complete table for 317-0033 (Alien Syndrome) and  317-0034 (S.Hang On) [R. Belmont].
- Updated Mahjong drivers to use new default controls [James Wallace].
- Updated Gladiator driver [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * Verified with schematics (though the schematics are very hard to read so there are still dubious places);
  * Converted to tilemaps, fixed scrolling;
  * Simplified tile decoding;
  * Flip screen support;
  * Fixed spriteram size;
  * Support for sprite dual buffer (this fixes sprite trails);
  * Adjusted YM2203 mixing levels so bass notes can still be heard (the audio mixing stage has some program controlled filters though which aren't supported);
  * Merged with ppking, drivers/ppking.c is no longer needed;
  * Proper blending of the fg layer (it's a palette effect not alpha blending).
- Improved video emulation in X Files [Tomasz Slanina].
