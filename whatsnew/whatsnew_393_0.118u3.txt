- zoom909_0118u2ora [Aaron Giles]


Source changes:
---------------
- Updated dacholer.c driver with now all known Dip Switches [stephh].
- Changed MDRV_VBLANK_DURATION macro to accept subseconds directly instead of converting from double. Added new macro USEC_TO_SUBSECONDS to assist in this. Converted all drivers over to using it [Atari Ace].
- Improved/fixed validation of memory maps to match current logic in memory.c. Fixed a few problems that were identified this way. Also removed construct_map_0 and isolated map construction to a single function [Atari Ace].
- Added new AM_READ_PORT() macro which lets you define an input port read callback based on a port tag. This is now preferred over the previous technique of calling port_tag_to_handler() within an AM_READ() macro. Updated all drivers that were using the latter pattern to the new system [Atari Ace].
- Fixed subtle monymony regression from 0.36b10(!) [Atari Ace].
- Fixed F8 CPU core to not clobbert the irq_callback on a reset [Wilbert Pol].
- Amiga system updates [Ernesto Corvi]:
  * Implemented the ECS-only BLTSIZV and BLTSIZH custom registers, and modified BLTSIZE and the blitter to use them;
  * Properly implemented the bit in VPOSR that indicates if we're running on a PAL or NTSC Amiga;
  * Fixed the PAL clock on the Pictomatic driver in alg.c.
- Added counter emulation to the COP420 CPU core. Hooked it up to Thayer's Quest and added an alternate set [Andrew Gardner].
- Added missing PROMs to the Status Trivia driver [Brian Troha].
- Cleaned up several Taito drivers (opwolf.c, othunder.c, topspeed.c, warriorb.c, wgp.c, rastan.c, rainbow.c, volfied.c) to use common input port macros. Fixed the Dip Switches for all games (a few still remain unknown though) and added many notes. Also fixed a couple of things which were wrong in ninjaw.c driver. Improved the C-chip emulation for "Operation Wolf" and its clones so it can now handle multiple coinage settings [stephh].
- Improved the MCU simulation for aladbl so now the game handles coins correctly. Fixed the Inputs to match an arcade cabinet and added Dip Switches according to the game M68000 code [stephh].
- Added build tool to extract version information and add it to the Windows version resource [Nathan Woods].
- Added a fairly complete WD33C93 SCSI controller emulation, and also updated the cps3.c driver to use it [Ernesto Corvi].
- Hooked up lamps in Chase HQ [R. Belmont, Couriersud].
- Changed NEC V30 CPU core to use a 16-bit data bus. Updated affected drivers: raiden, raiden2, m72, m90, m92, m107, segas32, hng64, deadang, dynduke, sengokmj, shanghai, lockon, tatsumi, fantland, twins, gunpey, ttchamp. Separated V-series disassembler from the i386 disassembler and updated it to use proper register and opcode terminology [Aaron Giles, Philip Bennett, Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Changed I8086 CPU core to use a 16-bit data bus. Updated affected drivers: gottlieb, leland, tx1, fantland, tetriunk. Cleaned up naming of CPUs (i86 -> i8086, etc.) [Aaron Giles].
- Added 16-bit handlers to a number of the shared PC components [Nathan Woods].
- Consolidated common code between drc and non-drc MIPS cores [Aaron Giles].
