-bus/sms_ctrl: Added support for Denpa XE-1AP controller [Vas Crabb].
 * This is the "horsehoe crab" game pad version of the Denpa Micom Soft Analog/Digital Intelligent Controller System (the other
    version is the desktop "cyber stick").
 * Mega Drive games only support this controller in analog mode (the default).  Digital mode is designed to be used for games on

-m6809: rename *.ops to *.lst [hap]

-Software list-provided default option fixes [AJR]
 * Give "slot_default" option values default priority rather than maximum priority, so command line option specifications can
    override these
 * Silently ignore software list-provided default options or values that don't exist in a particular system configuration

-emuopts.cpp: Correction for 42adf5d51de36560547449c6c279a8df9df7dcfe [AJR]

-machine/micomxe1a.cpp: Fudged timings to work with buggy CRI games [Vas Crabb].
 * CSK Research Institute games on FM Towns don't follow the same sequence as other games when reading inputs.  They depend on the
    data lines not being updated for some time after /Ack goes high, and can miss transitions if the timing is too tight (ironic
    that 16MHz '386 software has these issues when the 7MHz 6502 in the PC Engine gets by fine). This fudges the timings to work
    with the these buggy games without breaking the other use cases.
 * Also for some reason, these games expect an XE-1AP in MD mode with a Sega controller adapter - they won't work wth an XE-1AP in
    Personal Computer mode, and they won't work with the XE-1AJ or its NEC-branded relative.  In MAME you can flip the Interface
    setting to MD in the Machine Configuration options without needing to use an adapter device.

    not yet the default config to rate-limit MAME to one major IIgs change per release. To try it out early, change RUN_ADB_MICRO
    and ADB_HLE to (1) and rebuild.

-apple2gs.cpp: revert testing change that slipped into the previous commmit [R. Belmont].

    confused users.
 * Remember the selected tab and image in the right panel.  State for system selection menu is remembered across sessions.  Last
    used state for software selection menus is remembered across sessions.  Within a session, state is remembered separately for
    recently selected machines, similarly to the way filter selection is remembered.
 * Fixed some focus order issues in the software selection menu.
