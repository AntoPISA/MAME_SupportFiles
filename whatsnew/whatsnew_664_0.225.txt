-netlist: Remove copyright-infringing descriptions copy/pasted from datasheets [Vas Crabb].
 * Certain things are not considered "creative works" under copyright law, making them ineligible for copyright protection.  This
    includes pinouts (facts), descriptions of circuits (utilitarian), integrated circuit lithography masks (utilitarian, but there's
    a separate field of IP law protecting them), and character shapes (utilitarian).
 * However, many of these descriptions are substantial enough to be treated creative works.  A number of them include suggested
    applications.  There are situations where reproducing the descriptions may be permitted, for example:
   - The publisher may permit reproducing the entire datasheet for reference.
   - In some jurisdictions, fair use doctrine may allow the description to be quoted in its entirety in a larger creative work (e.g.
      in a research paper, patent application, or an original description of a circuit utilising the device).
   - Some jurisdictions allow reproduction of no more than 50% of a creative work for inclusion in teaching materials.
     * I am not confident that these soure code comments qualify as a situation where the long-form descriptions can be copied
        verbatim lawfully, especially without reproducing copyright notices for them.  If you want long form plain language
        descriptions in the comments, you need to write them yourself.  That way, you will be the copyright holder of the creative
        work, and you can make it availble under a permissive or "copyleft" license.

-Remove memarray.h from emu.h [AJR]

-device_state_interface overhaul [AJR]
 * device_state_entry::value and device_state_entry::set_value now do everything except the register lookup, allowing them to be
    made public. The debugger expression engine now uses these.
 * device_state_entry::dvalue and device_state_entry::set_dvalue have also been made public, theoretically permitting outside code
    layers to inspect and modify floating-point registers.
 * The double specialization of device_pseudo_state_register (now renamed device_functional_state_register) has been added to the
    core.
 * state_add now has an additional specialization that takes both a reference and a write function, using the former for reads only.
 * state_max_length has been eliminated in favor of obtaining the relevant info through device_state_entry::max_length.
 * The debugger state view no longer adds "flags" as "   " if none have been registered.
 * set_state_string has been removed. It was never properly implemented, and it is difficult to see how it could have been done in a
    useful and consistent way.
 * state_find_entry and its typical callers state_int and set_state_int have been inlined for some hopeful efficiency gains.

-inputdev.cpp: Fix oversight [AJR]

 * Fix android builds after mame-0.224.

-VG5000  updates: [Sylvain Glaize]
 * Add wavfile support for reading/writing tapes, for more accuracy. The currently supported K7 file type misses timing data.
 * VG5000  adds a wait cycle after the second T state of the M1 cycle of the Z80. Because it was not emulated, the timings were off,
    especially in the sensible cassette read/write routines.
 * With wavfile support added and timings fixed, the emulation can now read/write cassette at 1200 and 2400 bauds.
 * Still keeping the MACHINE_NOT_WORKING flag, as real hardware tests need to be complete.

-VG5000  update: [Sylvain Glaize]
 * Add support for the "Delta" key
   - The "Delta" key on the VG5000  keyboard is wired to directly assert the NMI line of the Z80. The handler for the NMI in the
      BASIC ROM checks if the CTRL key is also depressed and then causes a soft reset.
   - This routine can be hooked to produce other effects than soft reset.

-mz80: added missing natural keys [Robbbert]

-frontend: Added option to skip repeated imperfect emulation warnings [Vas Crabb].
 * The option is called skip_warnings, and it must be set in ui.ini (it can be set using the internal UI).  Red warnings cannot be
    skipped; yellow warning can be skipped under certain circumstances.
 * For a yellow warning to be skipped, the system must have been launched in a way that allows warnings to be displayed, in a
    configuration with the same set of devices flagged with unemulated/imperfect features, within the last seven days, and the
    warning must have been displayed within the past 14 days.
 * Also fixed a bug with display of the MACHINE_NO_COCKTAIL flag in the internal UI, and increased the size of XML integer
    attributes to 64 bits.

-add misc pal dumps [TwistedTom]

-unsp: Fix disassembly of unsigned*signed multiply instructions [AJR]

-frontend: Make unimplemented graphics and sound severe warnings [Vas Crabb].
 * This means you'll get an unskippable red warning for systems that have unimplemented sound or graphics that are otherwise marked
    working.  This also applies to subdevices, so for example plugging a non-working video card or sound card into a computer driver
    will now cause a red warning. This should make it clearer when a game is playable but missing sound, or when a video or sound
    card doesn't work.
 * The downside is that this could cause annoyance in a couple of situations.  Workstations/servers with unemulated video that have
    working serial terminals and networking will now cause a red warning, and terminals/keyboards/etc. with missing beepers, key
    click, etc. will now cause a red warning even if they're otherwise usable.
 * It may be worth making unimplemented controls and keyboard a severe error as well, since plugging in a non-working emulated
    keyboard is likely to make a system unusable.

-sawatte: Hack in some timer IRQs [AJR]

-pb1000: added some natural keyboard keys [Robbbert].

-util/xmlfile: Escape attribute and element content [Vas Crabb].
 * The previous behaviour was unintuitive - parsing an XML file and writing it out immediately would produce invalid XML if the file
    contained any characters that needed escaping.  It makes far more sense to escape on writing rather than expecting the user to
    escape input.

-Add preliminary support for visibility toggles to artwork system [Vas Crabb].
 * This allows the user to show/hide related elements in a view, with nesting.  The view can specify whether elements are shown or
    hidden by default.  Settings are saved per host window/screen per view.  There is no way to set the initial visibility state on
    the command line.  Legacy "Space Invaders cabinet model" layers are mapped onto visibility toggles.
 * This is not stable yet.  In particular, the XML element/attribute names have not been finalised.  The new features have not been
    added to complay.py to prevent them from being used before they're finalised.

-pet2001: fixed paste of letters [Robbbert]

-oric: fixed some natural keyboard issues; added savestate [Robbbert].

-Finished adding new mechanism for allowing parts of views to be hidden [Vas Crabb].
 * Changed name of element to "collection" and initial visibility attribute to "visible", and added them to documentation.  Also
    added them to complay.py.
 * Fixed issue with collection inside group, and improved initial view selection behaviour.
 * Updated some internal layouts to demonstrate new features, including et3400, irrmaze, ltcasino, mekd3/mekd4, seawolf and vgmplay.
 * Removed all uses of cpanel, marquee and overlay from internal layouts and removed them from complay.py to actively discourage
    use.  Also cleaned up view names in layouts that were using them in place of spaces, and removed some superfluous name
    attributes on elements that won't do anything useful with an output value anyway.
 * Made vgmplay cycle visualiser modes when visualiser screen is clicked.
 * Fixed a copy/paste error in bus/rs232/hlemouse.cpp while I'm at it.

-ti74: fixed +/* for natural keyboard [Robbbert]

-Bulk-updated layouts using bezels without backgrounds or screen [Vas Crabb].
 * These layouts had bezel elements only.  It makes no sense to allow turning off all elements in a layout leaving the user with a
    blank window.  (It's possible some of them are suited to breaking up using collections, but that's a bigger job.)

-nubus: Minor cleanup to fix deprecation warnings [AJR]

-pc98.xml: Remove whitespace in hash [Thomas Klausner]

-Bulk-updated layouts using backdrops without bezels or screens [Vas Crabb].
 * These are mostly automatically generated/converted fruit machine layouts.  They were fortuitously triggering the "alternate"
    layout mode by having multiple background elements without overlays, so alpha blending mode was used for all elements.

-tispellb: allow natural keyboard to operate the menu [Robbbert]

-sorcerer: corrected case of pasted text [Robbbert]

-Fixed issue that automatically generated unnecessary internal views [Vas Crabb].

-Updated a few more internal layouts, mostly bezel-only ones [Vas Crabb].
 * brkball wasn't using the DMD dots at all (it has a screen).
 * The Aristocrat layouts could use collections to allow buttons and tower lamps to be enabled/disabled independently.

-netlist: Pedantic and clang tidy updates [Couriersud]

 * Bounds were being miscalculated when the first element inside the group was inside a repeat or a collection.  Most visible in
    md6802.

-Updated another batch of layouts [Vas Crabb].
 * A lot of these were using a black backdrop element to force bounds when either explicit view bounds or an empty element is a
    better way to achieve the same thing.
 * Bally by17/by35 pinball layouts have had a bit of an overhaul with the three sections of the display now abled to be toggled
    independently.
 * Ensoniq VFD layouts refactored to reduce a very large number of lines down to a few nested repeats.

-Updated most of the layouts using <bezel> elements [Vas Crabb]

-Eliminate remaining <bezel> elements from internal layouts [Vas Crabb].
 * These layouts have changes to element stacking order that can't be avoided without changing the group structure in the layout
    files.  I think it's harmless, but it's possible it could have had a detrimental effect on risc2500 (I tested it and didn't see
    any changes, but I might not have known what to look for).

-complay.py: Added basic checks for dupicate collection names [Vas Crabb].
 * As with other checks of this kind, it doesn't actually instantiate the layout so it doesn't check things when variable

-Significant internal changes to sound streams (#7169) [Aaron Giles]
 * Significant internal changes to sound streams:
 * Abstracted buffers of sound data into an internal stream_buffer class, with helper classes read_stream_view and write_stream_view
    which offer readable/writable "views" into the buffers
 * Internal sound calculations are all done using stream_buffer::sample_t, which is a 32-bit float; existing callbacks are supported
    through an adapter that converts to/from signed 32-bit integers
 * Improved behavior of dynamic stream sample rate changes to resample a short runway of data to preserve continuity across
    transitions
 * Created a new stream update callback which passes a std::vector of read_stream_views for inputs, and a std::vector of
    write_stream_views for outputs
 * Updated core mixer and speaker devices to the new stream update callback
 * Updated the following sound cores to the new stream update callback: ay8910, dac, k054539, msm5205, namco, netlist, okim6295,
    pokey, samples, sn76496, sp0250, tms5220, tms57002, upd7759, vgm_visualizer, volt_reg
 * Changed existing stream update callback to make inputs explicitly const and the output pointers const as well, since they are
    re-used across calls; fixed several engines that violated this rule
 * Sound_manager::stream_alloc can no longer automatically connect to a device's sound_stream_update callback; instead, the
    stream_alloc() on the sound_device_interface should be called; updated many violators of this rule
 * Streams can be created with SAMPLE_RATE_OUTPUT_ADAPTIVE, which dynamically tracks the sample rate of its first downstream output,
    or with SAMPLE_RATE_INPUT_ADAPTIVE, which tracks the sample rate of its first input
 * Changed resampling to be a separate sound_stream that is invoked as needed, opening the path for selectable resampling
    implementations
 * Added a flags parameter to the new stream allocation method that allows you to specify a that input streams should not be
    resampled
 * Exposed stream_input and stream_output classes directly, simplifying access to user gains and stream names
 * Added a simple dynamic compressor to sound_manager to provide nicer results when overdriven sound happens; compression does not
    affect speaker_report results
 * Improved verbose speaker_report to print a graph of peaks over time
 * More aggressive debugging enabled for now even in release builds (should be disabled prior to next release) via SOUND_DEBUG
    define in sound.h; report any assertions for fixing

-emu/rendlay.cpp: Added parameter animation and state masks [Vas Crabb].
 * Components may have multiple bounds and/or color child elements with state attributes, allowing for piecewise linear
    position/size/colour animation.
 * Components may have a statemask attribute, allowing for things like using external images to draw a multi-segment LED/VFD display
    without requiring dozens of outputs for the individual lines or thousands of images for all possible states.  (Texture caching
    still never releases anything, so MAME can still exceed the maximum number of textures, but that s a separate issue.)
 * Image components with alpha now blend over previously drawn components.
 * Layouts have been changed to use yes/no for inputraw to match what's used for flipx/flipy.  External layouts with 1/0 will still
    work, but complay.py will complain.

Golden Nugget Casino [David Haywood, Sean Riddle]
Sudoku Plug & Play TV Game '6 Intelligent Games' [David Haywood, Sean Riddle]
Frogger (MSI Plug & Play, white joystick) [David Haywood, Sean Riddle]
35 in 1 Super Twins [David Haywood, Sean Riddle]
Vs. Maxx 17-in-1 [David Haywood, Sean Riddle]

-made use of the code that was already partially present in the NES PPU code to handle emphasis modes, used to highlight tally bars
 etc. in 'nes rampart', apply a red tint to 'fds bublbobl' and dim the screen in a number of other games [David Haywood].
 * fixed a number of issues with VT palette modes that was causing black screens in many games, allowing them to be promoted
 * added a timing kludge for interrupts in the NES Frogger titles, until timings are better overall,makes playfield stable here and
    in a number of other places so that other things can be improved
 * note "Vs. Maxx 17-in-1" was added as NOT WORKING in this same cycle so if this gets merged before freeze they'll need to be moved
    to the 'new working' section.
 * This is a checkpoint, further code improvements and refactors will come later.

-netlist: Fix 128 bit integer support. [Couriersud]

-netlist: clearly identify void * casts. [Couriersud]

-netlist: make pstring length/size use consistent. [Couriersud]
 * length reports the number of character codes in the string
 * size reports the size in memory units
 * Reminder: Set PSTRING_USE_STD_STRING to 1 in pstring.h and get native std::string
 * pstrings are compatible to std::string but only support a limited subset of functionality.
 * By default (always like this) utf8 is supported and thus length reports the number of multi-byte characters.

-Changed some sound devices back to using std::unique_ptr<T []> for things that don't need to change size [Vas Crabb].
 * Using a std::vector has additional overhead for keeping the size and allocated size, and it means you can inadvertently resize
    it.  Also, if you register one for save state then cause it to reallocate, very bad things happen.
 * Fixed some mixed tab/space indents in sound/mm5837.h
 * Changed namco_163.cpp to have registers as an array in the device, since there aren't many of them, and also restored zeroing
    them on start.
