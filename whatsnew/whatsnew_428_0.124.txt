New games added or promoted from NOT_WORKING status
---------------------------------------------------
Gekisou [Nicola Salmoria]
Mermaid [robiza]

New clones added
----------------
Ridge Racer (Rev. RR3, World) [Andrea Turci]


Source changes:
---------------
- [GTICLUB] Fixed crash [R. Belmont].
- [SCSI] Fixed case when no device exists (e.g. running the sys573 BIOS directly) [R. Belmont].
- Added Noise Output to the MSM5232 emulation [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added NVRAM to Gekisou. Fixed inputs and promoted to working [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added option in MC6845 to programatically set the clock pin. This is needed by at least one MESS driver. Added mc6845_set_hpixels_per_column() for the Hercules gfx adapter [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Added placeholder effects for cymbal and hihat to equites.c. These will need further work to properly emulate the discrete circuitry [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added validity check to ensure input port tags don't have duplicates. Fixed several drivers where there were duplicates [Aaron Giles].
- Another batch of pedantic static/const/include fixes [Atari Ace].
- bbusters: Fixed sprite wrapping - this is used on the gun calibration screen, at least. The game still hangs on a black screen after service mode is turned off. Even exiting MAME and restarting doesn't fix it, so it's probably a EEPROM issue [Zsolt Vasvari].
- blockhl.c, blockout.c: Added dip locations, fixed unknown dip switches [RansAckeR].
- Centralized definitions of _WIN32_WINNT. Removed malloc/calloc/realloc/free link-time overrides; we now rely exclusively on compile-time overrides. Made a few tweaks toward getting mingw-w64 working, but there are still linker issues [Aaron Giles].
- Changed crystal.c from RGB15 to RGB32. RGB15 is not enough bits to hold the 5-6-5 colorspace [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Changed the zombraid gun input ports to work with the calibrated settings [Derrick Renaud].
- Changed xmlfile.c to pass in memory handlers to expat so that our memory overrides are properly managed [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned cidelsa driver up to the latest spec [Curt Coder].
- Converted f-32, kinst, lethalj, ultrsprt, gamecstl, taitowlf to use INDEXED16 [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Corrected clocks on 'Cabal' bootleg [Corrado Tomaselli].
- ddz: Removed RGB15 - it's a "skeleton" driver, so why have it? [Zsolt Vasvari].
- De-deprecat-ed ui.c [Aaron Giles].
- dgpix and eolith: Converted to INDEXED16. Removed temp bitmaps. Changed ugly recursive video RAM code [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Explicitly fixed unmapped handler masks so that we don't report all unmapped addresses as 0 [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed assertions in skullxbo and exerion [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug in tx1.c spotted by new compiler warnings in gcc 4.3.0 [Atari Ace].
- Fixed crash running "kviper" BIOS [R. Belmont].
- Fixed crospang.c regression. Not sure why this needed to be RGB15, works fine with INDEXED16 [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed graphics ROMs in gnga [Cesare Falco].
- Fixed malzak2 from crashing [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed video timing in xtheball. Still don't know why it changed recently, but the new parameters reproduce the old values [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed wbbc97 regression [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Got most of the Konami PPC games running again [R. Belmont].
- Redid video timing in orbit with raw parameters. Added full memory map and a few other cleanups [Aaron Giles].
- Removed improper use of PERIODIC_INT in MPU4, to use new timer devices. Also corrected 50Hz timer in MPU4 Video games [James Wallace].
- Removed unnecessary assert in video.c that broke screenless games [Dirk Best].
- Updated astrof.c to use the timer device [Zsolt Vasvari].
- video\generic.c: Added PALETTE_INIT functions for common 16-bit RGB patterns [Zsolt Vasvari].
