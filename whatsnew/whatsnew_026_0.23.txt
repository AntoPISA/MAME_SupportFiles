Program changes:
----------------
- "And there was MUSIC!". Thanks to Ishmair's FM engine, music is supported in Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Diamonds.  Since the synthesis is based on FM generation via OPL, you must have a SoundBlaster, Adlib, or compatible to get the music. However I heavily dislike this approach and I'm looking for documentation on FM generation. If anyone want to join to the party forward me a mail! [Ishmair].
- I'v also fixed GALAGA hiscore saving, which is now flawlessy supported! ;) [Mirko Buffoni].
- I'v added Kung Fu Master driver to MAME.  Credits fly to Ishmair for the hardware information and to Nicola for fixing my sprite bugs [Mirko Buffoni].
- Provided a Williams games driver.  Stargate, Robotron and Joust are currently supported and playable. However 'Robotron' and 'Joust' have some glitches yet [Steven Hugg].
- Provided several modifications to Invaders Deluxe driver which has now Hi-score Name saving feature (the only one Space Invaders Emulator doing so at the moment!). All Invaders have now Tilt too. Keys and Dip Switch adjusted. REMEMBER TO DELETE PREVIOUS .DSW and .KEY FILES [Tormod Tjaberg].
- Provided a driver for QIX!  High Score saving  supported too [John Butler, Ed. Muller].
- 'Pacman Plus' has now 100% arcade correct colors [Dock Cutlip].
- While talking of colors, Ghosts 'n Goblins has 100% correct colors too! Provided us the complete colors LOG file ;) [Gabrio Secco, Mirko Buffoni].
- I'v fixed Seicross which is now playable and has music too. REMEMBER TO DELETE PREVIOUS .DSW FILE, AND SET "DEMO & DEBUG MODE" TO OFF [Mirko Buffoni].
- Also fixed Nibbler colors: I should say 100% correct colors, but I remember the Nibbler hairs were Green versus Purple. Maybe I played a bootleg version [Mirko Buffoni].
