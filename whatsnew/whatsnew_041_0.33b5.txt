These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Zaxxon supports rotation (albeit slow) [John Butler].
- Added the missing scrolling layer to Ghouls 'n Ghosts [Paul Leaman].
- Games which use the dynamic palette system and no longer need 16-bit modes: Section Z, Legendary Wings, Trojan, Speed Rumbler, Rygar, Silkworm, Gemini Wing, Tiger Road. The new code is also used by these drivers which were previously doing the palette reduction by themselves, but couldn't handle well color cycling and fades: Bad Dudes, Robocop, Hippodrome, Heavy Barrel, Sly Spy, Midnight Resistance [Nicola Salmoria].
- The Atari System 2 games automatically pick the 512x384 VESA resolution, instead of going for 1024x768 with pixel doubling. IMPORTANT: if your card doesn't support 512x384, they will not work. You'll have to specify -640x480 or -1024x768 [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed colors in Space Firebird [Chris Hardy].
- Fixed sprite/background priority in Gemini Wing [Nicola Salmoria].


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------
- Sound in Space Firebird [Dan Boris].
- Fixed bug in ADPCM sample playback. Many games are affected, e.g. Robocop, Bad Dudes [Nicola Salmoria].
- Attempt at making the main Galaxian/Moon Cresta sound channel more accurate [Nicola Salmoria].


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------
- Challenger, MegaTack, Killer Comet [Santeri Saarimaa].


Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- Mapped the unknown dip switch in Wonder Boy Deluxe [David Calandra].
- Added collision detection to Crazy Balloon [Mike Balfour].
- Fixes to the Gameplan games [Santeri Saarimaa].
- Us vs Them is playable, though of course you can't see the backgrounds which were stored on the laser disc. MACH 3 still doesn't work.


Source changes:
----------------
- New flag IPF_RESETCPU for input ports. When this flag is set, CPU #0 is reset when the key is pressed. This cleaned up the vicdual driver [Nicola Salmoria].
- IMPORTANT: drawgfx(...,TRANSPARENCY_THROUGH) now requires the caller to do the mapping with Machine->pens[]. This was necessary to allow for TRANSPARENCY_THROUGH, palette_transparent_color in dynamic palette games [Nicola Salmoria].
- Several fixes to improve Unix portability [Hans de Goede].
