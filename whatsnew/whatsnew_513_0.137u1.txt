Source changes:
---------------
- Added default nvrams to the ST-V driver [David Haywood].
- Improve text layer in LE2 [David Haywood]:
  * Set display enable to be ON by default.  LE2 doesn't turn it on until after the test screens, which would seem to indicate that the register should default to on, otherwise they're always invisible;
  * Added a kludge to use the right palette for the text layer in LE2, I haven't checked, but I wonder if this could also be related to internal defaults for the mixer chip which the game doesn't change;
  * This allows you to see the ram/rom tests anyway, which is better than an invisible startup.
- 680x0 FPU updates [R. Belmont]:
  * Rewritten to use SoftFloat instead of unportable native FP math;
  * Support added for Motorola 96-bit extended floats;
  * More addressing modes and conditions supported.
- Updates to toaplan1.c driver [Quench]:
  * Fixed flipscreen support for all toaplan1 games;
  * Added minimal Z180 place holder for SameSame/Fireshrk/Vimana.
- 500gp title screen says 1998, change driver to match [Guru].
- namcos23: Hook the 3D commands DMA [Olivier Galibert].
- Updates to Twincobr/Wardner drivers [Quench]:
  - twincobr.c:
  * Added 6845 CRTC interface;
  * Restored correct DSP roms loads and proms for (fsharkbt).
  - wardner.c:
  * Added 6845 CRTC interface;
  * Corrected some clock speeds.
- namcos23 housekeeping: Move months to mamedriv, fix 500 GP name [Guru].
- taitojc: Fix landgear crash, game now enters attract mode [R. Belmont].
- 65816: Fix decimal mode ADC/SBC behavior [blargg, byuu, R. Belmont].
- Improvements to Funworld driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Removed all hacks in the ROM load section. Now the involved sets are properly loaded in the same way the hardware does;
  * Replaced hardcoded values on graphics decode routines with proper RGN_FRAC calculations;
  * Fixed graphics bitplanes to involved games;
  * Added more hardware/technical info;
  * Modify the mongolnw machine driver. Now can see it starts;
  * Added Multi Win, from Funworld. The set is encrypted and use a custom CPU. Seems similar hardware than (multi) "Joker Card";
  * Added Fun World Quiz. Needs proper banking, and both graphics and bipolar PROM redumps.
- 680x0 FPU update [R. Belmont]:
  * Implemented FMOVECR;
  * Added load extended PC relative indexed support;
  * Cleanup some duplicated code.
- Added "Fun World Quiz" description, and hardware notes [Roberto Fresca].
- More improvements to Funworld driver [Roberto Fresca, David Haywood]:
  * Improved inputs for "Fun World Quiz";
  * Proper handlers and banking for "Fun World Quiz" questions;
  * Partial decryption for (royalcdc) and (multiwin);
  * Complete "Fun World Quiz" DIP switches with DIP locations;
  * Promoted "Fun World Quiz" to working state;
  * Added "Fun World Quiz" bookkeeping instructions notes.
- Added default NVRAM for Namco FL games and some Namco System 2 games [David Haywood].
- Implemented player 2 input buffer protection in "Winning Spike" [Angelo Salese].
- Implemented IRQ hack in the "Pastel Gal" driver and implemented GFX ROM readback in "Three Dealers Casino House" [Angelo Salese].
- More improvements to Funworld driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Reworked button-lamps layouts per game. Cleaned-up the code;
  * Added specific button-lamps layout for bigdeal games;
  * Added specific button-lamps layout for (royalcrd) and (jolycdit), but there is a bug in the d-up select code that lights the wrong lamp. This is a leftover from (jollycrd) routines;
  * Flagged vegasfte as GAME_NOT_WORKING, since is not receiving any coins or remote credits anymore.
- hng64: Lighting calculations are now more accurate [Andrew Gardner].
- Added driver data class and save states to: paradise.c, pasha2.c and pbaction.c [Fabio Priuli].
- Enabled saves states in pass.c (everything was already saved) [Fabio Priuli].
- snes.c: Reworked OAM drawing routines, implemented correct range over and time over flags (sprite limits), implemented FirstSprite priority [Fabio Priuli].
- snes.c: Moving more variables to driver data class and refactoring/cleaning up some code [Fabio Priuli].
- NamcoS21 cleanups [David Haywood]:
  * Added default NVRAM to Cybersled;
  * Limited the range of the analog inputs in Cybersled (the game glitches, causing you to move backwards if they hit the minimum/maximum);
  * Setup default key mapping in Cybersled to be similar to other dual joystick 'tank' style games, eg. Assault, rather than the default keyboard mapping where the sticks appear to be swapped;
  * Reworked the input ports a bit so that they include a common base rather than duplicating common inupts;
  * Renamed (aircombu) to (aircomb), and made it the parent instead of the Japanese set.
- Cave cleanups [David Haywood]:
  * Removed fake Region dipswitch that modified the region byte in the EEPROM each reset for "Sailor Moon", "Air Gallet" and "Mazinger Z";
  * Split out different regions into clones with different default EEPROMs instead, and ensured all EEPROMs are factory default for that region (this is a cleaner solution and more accurately represents the PCBs).
- dynax.c, ddenlovr.c: Added driver data class [Fabio Priuli].
- tlcs90.c: Added save states [Fabio Priuli].
- ddenlovr.c, dynax.c: replaced memory_set_bankptr with memory_set_bankp and added save state support [Fabio Priuli].
- spc700.c: Added save states [Fabio Priuli].
- snes.c: Updated the snes sound device to use device handlers, to store its internals in a struct, and to save them [Fabio Priuli].
- i386: fixed unaligned memory accesses and opcode fetches when they cross a page boundary. Previously, if pages were not ordered in contiguous RAM, then a cross-boundary read or write would read partially incorrect data or write some of the data in the wrong page [Barry Rodewald].
- png2bdc.c: When the usage is printed, the name displayed was "png2bdf" instead of "png2bdc"; this changes it by retrieving the name of the executable at runtime, so it will always be correct now [Christophe Jaillet].
- Several cleanups based on cppcheck and VS2008 Code Analysis [Oliver Stoeneberg].
- split.c: Made the "split" return the actual result instead of just 0 [Oliver Stoeneberg].
- clifront.c: Made the identation of the CPU device in -listdevices the same like the others [Oliver Stoeneberg].
- i386.c: Gave some fatalerror() calls in the i386 proper messages [Oliver Stoeneberg].

- sdl/window.c: Fixed a potential memory leak in sdlwindow_video_window_create() [Oliver Stoeneberg].
- metro.c: Added driver data class [Fabio Priuli].
- vmetal: Added driver data class and save states [Fabio Priuli].
- Verified all the clocks from Super Contra PCB as well as the vsync [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Implemented VRAM color bank select in Uncle Poo [Angelo Salese, Iq_132].

- Implemented pal bank in Three Dealers Casino House [Angelo Salese].
- Updated DIPs based on Stephh's notes and fixed location status. Added GAME_NO_COCKTAIL flag until flip screen is implemented [Tafoid].
- Fixed spinner input in moonwarp, added notes about spinner board, marked game as working [Lord Nightmare].
- Imported the same implementation of moon war proto's spinner to moon war 2; works much more smoothly now [Lord Nightmare].
- Fix very minor occasional glitches in moonwar/moonwara/moonwarp spinners caused by IPT_DIAL crossing the 0x00<->0xFF border. Added conditional Hyperflip button to moonwar, only seems present in upright mode? (in cocktail mode the same input is used by player 2 for a different button) [Lord Nightmare].
- Implement many of the dipswitches for moonwarp, and re-add the color test mode to frenzy; Cocktail/upright select is still missing from moonwarp, though I managed to trigger cocktail mode a few times by accident. Needs code study to see what it actually depends on. The p2 controls are separate in cocktail mode [Lord Nightmare].
- Fixed for good trasparency issues in "Three Dealers Casino House" [Angelo Salese].
- snes.c: Some internal refactoring, some new debug functions and a small mode7 fix [Fabio Priuli].
- Changed default initial state of PIC8259 to STATE_READY [Miodrag Milanovic].

- Final step in refactoring the video system in metro.c driver, replaced the video code with custom renderer functions [David Haywood].
- Improvements to funworld.c driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added dual-state palette (addressable through PLDs). This allow to choose which half of the palette will be addressed;
  * Splitted the main machine driver to cover both palette states;
  * Reworked inputs / DIP switches for vegasslw, vagasfst and vegasfte;
  * Created new default NVRAM for Royal Vegas Joker Card sets. These need to be configurated to be valid ones. Now vegasfte can receive remote credits, and all three in the family have valid min-max bet value and payout;
  * Removed the not working flag from vegasfte;
  * Improved colors for Big Deal sets;
  * Correct colors for Royal Vegas Joker Card sets.
- Hooked up default NVRAM in Five A Side Soccer [David Haywood].

  * Better IRQ generation and hookup to MAME IRQ system;
  * Preliminary 8-bit timer hookup including prescalers and IRQs;
  * Fixed issue with debugger not showing registers correctly.
- metro.c: Added save states [David Haywood, Fabio Priuli].
- snes.c: Updated DSP1, DSP2, DSP3, DSP4, OBC1, SRTC and ST010 addon chips to store their variables in struct and to save them [Fabio Priuli].
- More improvements to funworld.c driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added a second set of Jolly Card Professional. Documented the code differences;
  * Added another Royal Vegas Joker Card set, from Mile. These sets aren't intended to work with coins. Only remote credits are allowed. There are external modules that can manage up to 4 machines simultaneously, adding/removing/watching credits;
  * Added default NVRAM to the above sets;
  * Added proper inputs and DIP switches to vegasmil;
