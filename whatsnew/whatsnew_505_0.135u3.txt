- Cosmic: Fixed cosmica2 romset ROM split and names to match romset as described in mameinfo, which it matches (except for one ROM which mameinfo is probably wrong about). The romset uses a different ROM daughterboard to the other cosmica romsets, and different sized ROMs [Lord Nightmare].

  * Added Prologic-Noraut hardware support.
  * Added proper discrete sound support to Kimble games, and Prologic-Noraut Joker Poker.
  * Slightly adjusted the visual area. This can be wrong and must be rechecked.
  * Relocated the hardware notes and layouts to ROM_LOAD section, so can be seen/maintained in a cleaner way.
  * Fixed the default lamps state.
- Cleaned-up several drivers; added missing prototypes and removed dead ones, marked non-exported functions as static and removed cases of #include "deprecat.h" [Atari Ace].
- Aleck 64: Implemented player 2 inputs [Angelo Salese].
- Added a PCB layout for M.Kramer's Black Jack Poker, based on a hi-res pic. Also added undumped devices as NO_DUMP [Roberto Fresca].
- Added common driver data struct to timeplt.c, tutankhm.c, junofrst.c, pooyan.c, rallyx.c and rocnrope.c (these drivers all use audio/timeplt.c). As a side effect, we now have save states in junofrst.c and rallyx.c [Fabio Priuli].
- Converted atari drivers over to using driver_data for the most part. Some shared systems still exist with globals, but this tackles the atarigen module and the variables local to each driver [Aaron Giles].
- Added validity check that AM_BASE_MEMBER and AM_SIZE_MEMBER items point within the bounds of the driver_data structure [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed DMADAC wrapping behavior [Tim Schuerewegen].

  * Fixed EIP displacement when executing FPU instructions with no 80387 present.
  * Added 32-bit implementations of SLDT and STR.
- Converted Kaneko Pandora sprite chip to be a MAME device and updated drivers accordingly [Fabio Priuli].
- Added tilemap_create_device() function which lets you create a tilemap from within a device, and be passed that device in your callback [Aaron Giles].
- Converted Signetics 2636 video chip to be a MAME device and updated drivers using it accordingly [Fabio Priuli].
- Memory system changes [Aaron Giles]:
  * Memory banks are now referenced by tag rather than index. Changed all memory_bank_* functions to specify a tag. Bulk-converted existing banks to be tagged "bank##" in order to ensure consistency. However, going forward, the tags don't matter, so please name them something useful.
  * Added AM_BANK_READ/AM_BANK_WRITE macros to let you specify bank tags. Also changed AM_ROMBANK and AM_RAMBANK macros to accept tags as well.
  * Added new functions memory_install_read_bank_handler and memory_install_write_bank_handler to install banks by tag name, similar to input ports.
  * Changed internals of memory system to dynamically allocate all banks. The first time a bank with an unknown tag is installed, a new bank object is created and tracked internally.
  * Removed SMH_* macros entirely. In their place are a series of expanded macros and new memory installation helpers. Some mappings below (not all are new):

  AM_READ(SMH_RAM)                            -> AM_READONLY
  AM_WRITE(SMH_RAM)                           -> AM_WRITEONLY
  AM_READWRITE(SMH_RAM, SMH_RAM)              -> AM_RAM
  AM_READ(rhandler) AM_WRITE(SMH_RAM)         -> AM_RAM_READ(rhandler)
  AM_READ(SMH_RAM) AM_WRITE(whandler)         -> AM_RAM_WRITE(whandler)
  AM_DEVREAD(tag, rhandler) AM_WRITE(SMH_RAM) -> AM_RAM_DEVREAD(tag, rhandler)
  AM_READ(SMH_RAM) AM_DEVWRITE(tag, whandler) -> AM_RAM_DEVWRITE(tag, whandler)
  AM_READ(SMH_ROM)                            -> AM_ROM
  AM_WRITE(SMH_ROM)                           -> (was a no-op)
  AM_READ(SMH_NOP)                            -> AM_READNOP
  AM_WRITE(SMH_NOP)                           -> AM_WRITENOP
  AM_READWRITE(SMH_NOP, SMH_NOP)              -> AM_NOP

  * For dynamic memory handler installation of the various types, use the new functions:

  memory_unmap_read()
  memory_unmap_write()
  memory_unmap_readwrite() -- unmaps a section of address space
  memory_nop_read()
  memory_nop_write()
  memory_nop_readwrite() -- nops a section of address space

  * Cleaned up the internals of the address_map_entry structure, and also normalized the way the address map macros work to remove a lot of redundancy.
  * Renamed functions: memory_install_read/write_port_handler to memory_install_read/write_port.
  * Memory shares are now specified by tag instead of index. The AM_SHARE() macro now takes a tag parameter. All existing shares have been bulk renamed to "share##". However, the name does not matter, so please use descriptive tags going forward.
  * Added tag validation for bank and share tags.
  * Added flag to tagmap_add functions that optionally will replace existing objects if a duplicate is found.
  * Internal code shuffling. Address maps initialized internally now call the same installation handlers that drivers do for dynamic installation. Cleaned up some parameter ordering and error detection.
  * Added new functions:
  - memory_install_ram() to assign a un-named bank to a region and specify a pointer to where the RAM lives. If this is called in the DRIVER_INIT function or MACHINE/SOUND/VIDEO_START functions, then it is permissible to specify NULL, in which case the memory system will allocate memory and register it for save states.
  - memory_install_rom() is like the above except that it only installs a read handler.
  - memory_install_writeonly() is like the above except that it only installs a write handler.
  - Updated several instances in the code that were assigning banks to these sorts of static RAM regions and simplified the code.
  * Apply mirrors and global masks at address map detokenizing time rather than later.
