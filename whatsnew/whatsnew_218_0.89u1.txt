Source changes:
---------------
- Sega Improvements [Aaron Giles]:
  Sega System 16A:
  * Included detailed readme in the driver file;
  * Hooked up column/row scroll (see quartet title screen) -- don't know if it's really right yet;
  * Reintroduced tilemap/text priorities;
  * Corrected Z80 clock speed;
  * Incorporated Brian Troha's updated DIPs;
  * Minor cleanups.
  Sega System 16B:
  * Fixed ROM bank mapping so it doesn't fall through to unmapped handlers;
  * IncorporatedBrian Troha's updated DIPs;
  * Minor cleanups;
  * Fixed column scroll after talking to Charles about how it works.
  Sega System 18:
  * Fixed ROM bank mapping so it doesn't fall through to unmapped handlers (fixes Shadow Dancer crash);
  * Expanded memory mapping code so it works from the 8751 as well as the 68000;
  * Hooked up the 8751 in mwalk/mwalka/mwalkb -- these all work now;
  * Removed coin lockouts as they were breaking several games' coin inputs;
  * Hooked up Laser Ghost controls and added crosshair drawing (not 100% yet, feel free to tweak);
  * Hooked up Where's Wally controls;
  * Fixed astorm's Player 3 controls;
  * Cleaned up ddcrew's inputs;
  * Fixed sound ROM loading in astorma/astorm2p/mwalk*;
  * Incorporated Brian Troha's updated DIPs;
  * Minor cleanups;
  * Added sprite masking effect used by Where's Wally;
  * Fixed column scroll after talking to Charles about how it works (ddcrew attract mode scrolls properly now);
  * Went through and fixed VDP priorities in all S18 games; everything should be correct now, let me know if you find anything not right.
- Fixed i8051 cpu core bugs. Uses correct read/write memory routines for external accesses	support for external IRQs [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed an rf5c68 memory access bug [Aaron Giles].
- Improvements to Hyper Crash: Now mostly working apart from controls and a gfx glitch on the player car [Angelo Salese].
- More Taito F2 Blending Improvements [Bryan McPhail]:
  * Added the TC0360PRI blending modes to the games with rotation layers. This	includes Pulirula & Liquid Kids. One of the blending modes is new to these games (not used in Gun Frontier) and I have no way to verify it's actually correct - someone with a working board will need to verify (Liquid Kids -fish going in water in attract mode, Pulirula - crystals on level 2).
- Fixed colours in Flower [Bryan McPhail]
- Fixed small problem in CHDCD [R. Belmont].
- Fixed stereo sound in Jaleco MegaSystem1 games [R. Belmont].
- Misc Compiler Patches [Lawrence Gold].
- Modified Frogs driver to only use samples when actually needed [Derrick Renaud].
- PPC Core improvements (603 support) for Sega Model 3 [Ville Linde].
- Several fd1094 games now run with new keys [Thierry, Gerald].
- Temporarily disabled ym2151 save states until we work out why its crashing in debug/symbol/map builds.
- Various cleanups [Atari Ace].
- Workaround for excessive RAM use in Hyperstone based games [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
