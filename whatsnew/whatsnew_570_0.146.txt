Source changes:
---------------
- 68681: Timers start immediately; unlike counters they don't wait for a start command [R. Belmont].
- Added custom DCR read/write handlers to PPC CPU core [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Added I/O board ROM dump for Ninja Assault [Tormod, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union].
- Added NMI sound ACK mechanism to tecmo.c driver [Angelo Salese].
- Added PPC405GP to PPC cpu core [Lukasz Markowski].
- Added the 700B01 BIOS, only the CRC is known [smf].
- Added the alternative bios found on Gachagachamp, it appears to just be recompiled [smf].
- Chance 32 driver improvements [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added a nice button-lamps layout;
  * Added lamps support;
  * Completely demuxed the output lines;
  * Corrected the refresh rate to 52.786 Hz (similar to Major Poker);
  * Figured out the following DIP switches: Auto Max Bet, Flip Screen, Maximum Bet, Auto Hold, Double-Up Type, Remote Credits, Bet Limit, and Coinage Multiplier;
  * Fixed the Oki6295 and CRTC 6845 clocks;
  * Found and added the FEVER! lamp;
  * Hooked the vblank input line;
  * Inputs from the scratch.
- Convert all remaining drivers to use the modern pokey device [Couriersud].
- Correct labels for bcruzm12 and replaced overdumped ROM from butasan based on PCB pictures and observation [bonky0013, Tafoid].
- Corrected some off by one errors in DM01 dot matrix emulation, while making it a bit more generic. Ultimately, it will plug into Scorpion 2 and 4 hardware [James Wallace].
- Don't optimize tms57002 on OS X PowerPC builds [Couriersud].
- Emulated the protection(s) in lhzb2a, making it playable [Luca Elia].
- Finally done the last part of the dotmatrix changes, which is to create a dot by dot display mode. This makes the BFMDM01 emulation far more straightforward, and should mean that anyone wanting a matrix can call some combination of functions and make it work [James Wallace].
- Fix for i286 preventing error 104 on ibm5170 [Carl].
- Fix regression on POKEY device introduced in last commit. Fixed high pass filters for POKEY. Added POKEYN device based on modern device.
- Fixed ffightj2 ROMs labels and locations, added - PCB infos to video\cps1.c [Team CPS-1].
- Fixed mapping for mmatrixd (cps2) to allow in-game region switch to work and renamed to a US set due to ROM labels. Replaced Phoenix Set xmvsfu1d (cps2) bad dumps with others which pass in-game ROM tests [Barry Harris].
- Fixed random lfsr generation in pokey.c. This fixes MT00501 while tempest is still starting up [Couriersud].
- galspnbl.c: Add in missing button to Gals Pinball & Hot Pinball along with misc documentation [Brian Troha].
- gei.c: Refactored Trivia ROM questions. Added misc documentation. Added DSW locations to several sets [Brian Troha].
- i386: Another small vm86 fix [Carl].
- i386: IRET/Virtual 8086 mode fixes [Carl].
- i8251: "reset" bit is only documented to revert to looking for a mode byte, not reset the entire chip [R. Belmont].
- Improved sound emulation in for pokey chip. Changed audio emulation to emulate borrow 3 clock delay and proper channel reset. New frequency only becomes effective after the counter hits 0. Emulation also treats counters as 8 bit counters which are linked now instead of monolytic 16 bit counters [Couriersud].
- info.c: added screen tags to xml output, so that it is possible to easily identify which screens depend on optional devices (mostly of use in MESS, for its slot options, but eventually handy for PC-based arcades too) [Fabio Priuli].
- Initial work in preparation for some modernization on the whole megadriv.c file, starting with better splitting of actual drivers (megadriv.c, megacd.c, mega32x.c, megasvp.c and megavdp.c) [David Haywood].
- mc68681: Fixed generation of spurious interrupts, and provide ASSERT/CLEAR states to the IRQ callback [R. Belmont].
- Migrated bzone, ccastles and missile to use this device [Couriersud].
- Misc documentation updates and typo fixes for neogeo.xml as well as updates and a cleanup of neodrvr.c [Johnboy].
- More Z8001 work, M20 now passes memory test [Christian Grassler].
- New Mega-Tech BIOS added [El Barto].
- Preliminary Toshiba TC8830F emulation [hap].
- Preliminary Z8001 support [Christian Groessler].
- segas16b.c: Corrected the ROM labels for the Japanese Cotton set and added the Sega ID# for the ROM board [Tormod, The Dumping Union].
- Small Konami update [Mamesick]:
  * aliens.c: Reverted wrong changes applied in 0.145u8.
  * crimfght.c: Reverted wrong changes applied in 0.145u8.
  * vendetta.c: Small cosmetic changes plus PCB components verified.
- spbactn.c: Adjusted clock speeds based on OSCs actually on the PCB. Added missing button and labeled buttons. Added DIP switch locations and misc documentation [Brian Troha].
- Stop the elephant stage on Handle Champ from crashing, though other graphics issues remain [smf].
- This is phase 2 of the DMD changes, creating a new '5 dot' element to make it more like the actual DM01 (which uses 5 by 7 blocks, but wires them up row wise to a buffer, giving an unusual '65 dot row') [James Wallace].
- timeplt.c: Added inputs to chkun and bikkuric, making them playable [hap].
- Updating MAME drivers to use modern i8255 implementation instead of the legacy one [Fabio Priuli]
- Z8001 has 16-bit wide I/O ports [R. Belmont, Christian Grassler].
- Z8001: Fix inb/outb @rX form.  M20 PPI test now passes [R. Belmont].
