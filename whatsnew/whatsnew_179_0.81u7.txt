Source changes:
----------------------
- Sound in the ST0016 driver [R.Belmont, Tomasz Slanina]: Neratte Chu & Renju Kizoku now have sound.
- Misc Cleanups [Lawrence Gold].
- Fixed a couple of issues with hard disks without checksums [smf].
- Dipswitch corrections for Karate Blazers, Turbo Force, Raiden 2 [Brian Troha].
- Megaplay Improvements [Barry Rodewald, GreyRogue].
- SPI / 386 updates [Ville Linde]:
  * Added the missing keys to E-Jan.
  * Added layer enable register.
  * Wrote a new i386 disassembler. Dasm386 wasn't always showing stuff correctly, and now the i386 core can be compiled without i86.
  * Preliminary Dallas DS2404 (RTC/CMOS) emulation.
  * Added 93C46 eeprom to RF2 single and RF2 2K. It's not hooked up though.
  * Improved i386/z80 interleaving. This should help with the small pauses.
  * Fixed some stuff in the i386 core. These don't seem to affect the SPI games, but should help with MESS.
- 386 Improvements [Nathan Woods]:
  * Adds a check enabled when MAME_DEBUG is defined that raises an error if the CPU core executed a negative cycle count.
  * Fixed a bug in i386_set_info() when changing the EIP register.
  * Fixed some compilation errors under non-GCC compilers
  * Implemented ES, BOUND, DAA, DAS, AAS, INSB, INSW, OUTSB, OUTSW, LES, LDS, HLT, LSS, LFS, LGS, IMUL with a 32 bit adjustment.
- 386 Improvements [Ville Linde]:
	* Added DS and SS segment prefixes. renamed fs,gs -> segment_FS, segment_GS.
	* Added INTO opcode.
	* Regression tested and fixed AAS opcode (incorrect behavior in Intel docs).
	* Added AAA opcode (with correct behavior).
	* Added AAD and AAM opcodes.
	* Added CMC opcode
	* Added SETALC opcode which is undocumented	
	* removed a non-existing PUSH8 opcode from groupFE_8. Doh ;-)
	* Regression tested and fixed SHLD and SHRD opcodes.
	* Fixed AF flag calculation.
	* Fixed AF flag in SUB and DEC opcodes.
- Beatorizer (bootleg) improvements [smf].
