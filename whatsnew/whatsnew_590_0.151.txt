Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed regression in Crypt Killer [smf].
- Use virtual multiple inheritance to share command processing between SCSI & ATAPI instead of having a SCSI subdevice. This allows matsushita_cr589_device & gdrom_device to derive from atapi_cdrom_device [smf].
- kungfum: Use 8-way joysticks [Phil Bennett].
- web: Fixed hardcoded hostname and port in index.html [Firehawke].
- Moved the adaptec mode sense handling into the ACB4070 device [smf].
- web: Fix rendering issues on WebKit-based phones in portrait mode, added pause/unpause toggle [Firehawke].
- sh2: Show effective address in disassembly of PC-relative instructions [R. Belmont, based on a patch by Darksoft].
- cps3: Added some new (and some previously just not included) documentation [R. Belmont, based on a patch by Darksoft].
- New AM_(DEV)SETOFFSET feature for address maps [Michael Zapf].
- tms9900.c: Fixed debug memory access [Michael Zapf].
- tms9995.c: Fixed debug memory access, MID interrupt, and decrementer [Michael Zapf].
- SDL: work around incorrect warning generated by Clang [R. Belmont].
- Better Clang support, necessary for Xcode 5.0 on OS X [R. Belmont].
- m68000: The 68010 does not perform a read before write during a CLR instruction [Phil Bennett].
- web: Load and save states [Firehawke].
- cps3: Improved readme with more hardware detail [Guru].
- web: Fix web options reading from ini, improved load/save state UI [Firehawke].
- 1943.c: Improved protection emulation [Dave].
- web: More UI improvements [Firehawke].
- web: Additional refactoring [Firehawke].
- m68k: Add FSCALE instruction used by e.g. SimCity 2000 [R. Belmont].
- web: Modernized JS usage, fixed several bugs [Firehawke].
- Added some more meter communication to System 5 and MPS, games should complain about less now [J. Wallace].
- Deprecated MCFG_SCREEN_VBLANK_TIME() / MCFG_SCREEN_REFRESH_RATE() in [Angelo Salese] favor of MCFG_SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS() function for the following drivers: 
  * twin16.c (except fround);
  * yunsun16.c;
  * yunsung8.c.
- web: JS cleanup and fixed a few minor bugs [Firehawke].
- thepit.c: Dumped the color BPROM for, and corrected colors in, Desert Dan [Zab].
- SCSP: improved DMA and fixed triggering from SH-2 side [Angelo Salese].
- ncr5380n: Better DRQ support, fixed arbitration-in-progress bit [R. Belmont].
- SDL: Updated man pages [Cesare Falco].
- Improvements to Dragon World 3 protection simulation, game seems mostly playable now although a DMA mode copying 68k code to RAM is still missing [iq_132].
- Added a hack to get konami 80's loading games again. It misses out triggering dma for three sectors, the old code didn't care as it didn't check for how much had been requested. Why it does this and what should actually happen is currently unknown [smf].
- wpc_an: Various additions, games now have full sound [Barry Rodewald]:
  * Added WPC sound board and hooked up to WPC boards;
  * Added shifter functions to WPC chip (fixes inputs);
  * Added preliminary memory protection.
- ptblank: Documented how the protection works [Guru, R. Belmont].
- peplus.c: Huge update of information, clones and new games [BrianT].
- Moved request sense command into t10spc, supporting the old obsolete format and the new one [smf].
- Stopped div 0x80000000, 0xffffffff from causing an overflow exception. All loads cancel an outstanding load to the same register, not just lwl/lwr [smf].
- Fixed read toc to always return the lead out & return the correct results for msf requests. Mounting the same iso in Windows 8 produces a slightly different result, but it's enough to make windows 2000 recovery console and windows 95a work [smf].
- Uses the sff8020 read toc legacy format field if the mmc format field is zero (MSCDEX uses the sff8020 format field instead of the mmc format field). Added support for session format for read toc, we only support 1 session so the data is mostly hard coded. Fixed read sub command when subq bit was not set [smf].
- Fix for mametester 5328, switched guitar freaks 2 to a 32mb card. It only flashes 16mb to the flash card but it checks and erases 32mb. Consistent code formatting [smf].
- pacland.c: Added Easter egg notes [cmonkey].
- model3.c: Correct ROM names and revision levels for The Lost World and Le Mans 24 [ShouTime].
- lastduel.c: Various fixes [Phil Bennett]:
  * Fixed madgear and clones background tilemap bitplane order;
  * Fixed madgear and clones vertical refresh rate;
  * Added buttons 2 and 3 to madgear and clones;
  * Fixed ledstorm2 sprite ROM order (though bad sprites remain due to incorrect ROMs).
- Changed atapicdr packet identify to Virtual CDROM because not all images are compressed & the text no longer starts in the middle of the vendor name (software displaying the vendor name used to display "MAME Com"). Added a cdu76s device so that the inquiry for the generic ATAPI and SCSI cdrom drives can also be set to "Virtual CDROM". However none of the Konami GV games care, so I'm not sure which game required that response & that is the only Konami SCSI CD based system. The response is invalid according to the SCSI spec as the strings should be space filled and not null terminated & there are fields not filled in. So it's currently compiled in but not used [smf].
- Added the ability to view PALCE16V8 jed files along with some regression test data for the PALCE16V8. The pal dumps for 'Twin Cobra 2' in the Taito F3 driver are now labeled as bad dumps because when viewed with jedutil the data is bad [Kevin Eshbach].
- cosmicg: Using new TMS9980 implementation [Michael Zapf].
- zippath.c: Fixed crash in debug builds [somebody].
- Fixes for building with Visual Studio 2013 RTM [smf].
- i186: Added internal clock divider [Curt Coder].
- tms57002: Implement SFMR instruction [Phil Bennett].
- cosmic.c, jpmsru.c, jubilee.c, jvh.c, looping.c, nsmpoker.c,  pachifev.c, supertnk, tmspoker: Using new TMS9980/95 implementation [Michael Zapf].
- winfile: Allow write-only files to be opened by external programs while MAME still has them open (matches POSIX semantics, useful for log files) [Firehawke].
- web: Page not found handling, sends a 404 error [Firehawke].
- isbx: Added a placeholder for the Intel iSBX bus [Curt Coder].
- 8080bw.c: Changed Space Invaders Stand-up Version (sisv) sets around based on new information/dumps from Andrew Welburn; sisv2->sisv, sisv->sisv3, new set sisv2, placeholder set sisv1; many comment changes as well. Removed accidentally included overlay roms from sisv sets. Also changed sitvo->sitv1 [Andrew Welburn, Lord Nightmare].
- Fix for mametesters 05216 by defaulting RAM to 0. I don't know whether this is guaranteed or whether it's a game or emulation bug. Also tidied up a few things and added a couple of comments [smf].
- spc700ds.c: Fix disassembly of BRK opcode [Lord Nightmare, jwdonal].
- Updated comments/rom names for Cosmic Monsters (version II)  [Andrew Welburn].
- SDL: OS/2 build fixes [KO Myung-Hun].
- 8080bw.c: Fix Space Invaders ROM names again, add more comment information [Andy Welburn, Lord Nightmare].
- Added i80130 OSP emulation [Curt Coder].
- SDL: Add SDL_FRAMEWORK_PATH option to control where SDL is installed on OS X plus OS X 10.9 support. Started removing deprecated GTK+ debugger [R. Belmont, Balrog].
- SDL: Remove deprecated GTK+ debugger [R. Belmont].
- Changed IDE read sector timing to be the same as read multiple instead of write sector [smf].
- spc700ds.c: Fix disassembly of memory-to-memory and immediate-to-memory instructions [Alex Jackson].
- Hardcoded toggled inputs (eg. simulated hi-lo gearshift-lock in racing games) can now be manually turned off or on by the user [hap].
- Hooked up DSP/GPU interrupt to tom that was missed when modernizing jaguar core in r24736. Fixes Area 51 issue mentioned in mametesters 05256, but 0.149u1 was released before the modernizing and maxf_ng still has the problem mentioned in the bug report [smf].
- ncr5380n: Improved /BSY behavior on arbitration [R. Belmont].
- Preliminary Master volume control for Deco MLC HW [Angelo Salese].
- Un-marked the 2608 ROM as bad, since AFAIK Jarek did test this dump as an external ROM and it completely matched the internal ROM when played back, digitally compared at the dac input. Also re-added comments from the original fm.c version. It would be best if we can find a 2608 to decap eventually, though [Lord Nightmare].
- quizshow.c: Dumped one of the gfx proms, the other one was wounded in action [Siftware].
- vsnes.c: Flip the 'right' and 'left' half roms for vs baseball english set to match ROM labels from recent ROM redump, also fixed labels to exactly match chips. [Lord Nightmare, Dead_Body].
- Fixed the MC146818 modernisation so that local/utc & whether a century is stored in NVRAM can be specified in a sane way. Removed the century updating as this chip doesn't do that, but each driver can specify where the century should be stored. Fixed off by one errors in the date/time updating. Added support for different external clock speeds and dividers, the clock speeds have been set based on guesswork that the code would set the chip to update at 1hz but this isn't necessarily true. Most flags have been implemented, so that timer updating can be disabled & irq generation should be correct [smf].
- ppccom.c: Fix and simplify PPC4xx DMA interrupt logic. Fixes goal animations in fiveside [Phil Bennett].
- Added a hack to allow you to limit the number of threads per work queue (all other limits still apply). If you set this to 0 then chdman doesn't hang [smf].
- Support for different sized MC146818 compatibles [smf].
- nss.c: Added a new Nintendo Super System bios, Single Cart version 3 [Porchy].
- Upstream changes needed to compile JSMESS [Justin Kerk, John Vilk, Justin de Vesine].
- wboy4 documentation updates [Irongiant].
- Small fix for -listxml dumps regarding output of DIP switches [Andreas Singer].
- IPT_START changed to IPT_START1 or IPT_START2 where multiple start
 buttons exist [MASH].
- tia.c: Per official documents and hardware results, the NTSC palette was updated to better simulate CRT display [Robert Tuccitto].
- NeoGeo improvements [Alex Jackson]:
  * Cleaned up large amounts of duplicated code between the MAME and MESS (AES/NeoCD) drivers;
  * Removed MVS-only ROMs and devices (SM1 ROM, SFIX ROM, upd4990a RTC, etc.) from AES/NeoCD;
  * Replaced legacy NVRAM in MVS and NeoCD with NVRAM devices;
  * Correctly hooked up SM1 ROM bankswitching; the BIOS sound test works now;
  * Corrected VRAM size;
  * Sorted the Universe BIOS versions and unified them between MAME and MESS;
  * Fixed kf10thep ROM loading and decryption which was a horrible hack (and not endian safe);
  * Replaced svcplus protection hack ROM patch with a less invasive one, based on FBA;
  * Started marking code and data that should be moved out into devices;
  * Various other code and comment cleanups.
