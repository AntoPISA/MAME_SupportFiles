These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Fixed priorities in wndrmomo and genpeitd [E. Watanabe].
- Fixed sprite lag in cps1, bionicc, lastduel [Bryan McPhail].
- Fixed sprite Y offset in the Simpsons dreamland level. Apologies for taking so long, I couldn't find the time to play it that far and hadn't realized I just had to use the attract mode of the Japanese version [Nicola Salmoria].
- Sped up a little the NeoGeo raster effects. Enabled them in 'Karnov Revenge' and 'Galaxy Fight'. Fixed the field in ssideki3 etc [Massimo Morra].


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------
- CVSD sound in 'Mouse Trap' [Dan Boris, Aaron Giles].


Source changes:
--------------------
- [DOS] Changed the autoframeskip code, making it less anxious to increase frameskip as soon as speed drops below 100%. Let's see if this makes things better or worse [Nicola Salmoria].
- [DOS] Support for ZIPped input files (-playback) and artwork. Well, PNG won't compress very well, but I added it anyway ;) [Juergen Buchmueller].
- [DOS] The mouse buttons are no longer aliases for joystick buttons, they are independently recognized. They are still considered "joystick" inputs though, so if you want to use them you have to redefine the controls in the Joystick menu. This is a minor annoyance that was needed to allow interfacing a Discs of Tron controller to the mouse port (spinner + up and down switches) while still using joystick buttons 1 and 2 for fire and deflect [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added vh_eof_callback to the MachineDriver structure. See bionicc, cps1, lastduel for usage examples [Nicola Salmoria].
- C140 emulation [Phil Stroffolino].
- Cleaned up the 6809 and Konami-2 emulations [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Finally fixed the CMPX instruction in the 680x core. On the 6800 it does not affect the C flag, on the others (6803, 63701) it does [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Fixes to the x86 asm 68k core [Mike Coates].
- VIDEO_BUFFERS_SPRITERAM. See bionicc, darkseal, lastduel for usage examples [Bryan McPhail].
