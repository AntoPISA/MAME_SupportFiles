0.11 1997/03/16 [#010 - Nicola Salmoria]
----------------------------------------
[NOTE: Only important changes are listed]


New games supported:
--------------------
(btime)    Burger Time (Midway) [Mirko Buffoni]
(dkong3)   Donkey Kong 3 (US) [Mirko Buffoni]
(mpatrol)  Moon Patrol (Williams) [Nicola Salmoria]


Program:
--------
- Burger Time and Donkey Kong 3 drivers provided by Mirko Buffoni. The colors for Burger Time should be accurate, but I'm not quite sure - can anyone confirm? [Mirko Buffoni].
- Fixed joystick controls for Congo Bongo [Nicola Salmoria].
- Lionel Theunissen dumped the color PROM of his Uniwars board and... it's different from the one provided by Gary Walton. Galaxian boards were widely pirated so it's difficult to determine which one is the "correct" palette. What I did was set the Uniwars driver to use one palette, and the "Japanese Irem" to use the other. Play the one you prefer.
- Provided a much better palette for Zaxxon [Marc Vergoossen].
- Moon Patrol support. There is no scrolling background because I don't know where to place it... can anyone provide a screen snapshot? [Nicola Salmoria].


Source changes:
---------------
- Increased the maximum size of the graphic elements that can be handled by decodegfx() from 32x32 to 64x64. Actually I would have needed 256x64 to do Moon Patrol backgrounds, but that seemed slightly overkill ;-) [Nicola Salmoria].
