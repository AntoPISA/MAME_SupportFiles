Source changes:
---------------
- Added a call winwindow_ui_exec_on_main_thread() to allow code on the window thread to cause a function to be executed on the main thread [Nathan Woods].
- Added a new mechanism for building in fonts. A new tool, png2bdc can convert a specially formatted PNG file into a binary cached MAME font. This cached font can be embedded into MAME. A new default small UI font is now included, and built via this process to replace the old hard-coded one. The new font is proportional, so there is better use of limited screen real estate in small video modes. Some balancing tweaking of the actual font still needs to be done, and some basic functionality still needs to be added to png2bdc. Consider this a work-in-progress [Aaron Giles].
- Added DIP switch locations based on information from the manuals for the following drivers: Karnov, Magmax, Omega Race, Spiders, Bagman and Bank Panic [Justin Szczap].
- Began converting drivers over to the new more accurate video timing functions (video_screen_* functions instead of cpu_*). This first batch includes all the games using the TMS34010 chip and the Atari games that use atarigen.c [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Built iButton data for ppd [Ian Patterson].
- Built the iButton data for keyboardmania 2nd mix and Pop'n Music 7. With this update Pop'n Music will also show the self tests [Ville Linde].
- Fixed a crash when verifying samples when a sample has a NULL name [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed sample audit to report all missing samples [BUT].
- Fixed the rest of the Atari games and the Cinematronics CCPU games to use the newer video timing system. Also fixed reset problem in Destroyer [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed timer dipswitch in Alien Syndrome set 1 [Don Maeby].
- Fixed Windows-isms in regrep.c [Couriersud, Aaron Giles]
- Improvements to the kaneko driver. All the protection data should be correct now [Sebastien Volpe].
- Marked unknown dips for 005 according to manual [Mike Ellery].
- Moved throttling, frameskipping, fast forwarding, and timing into the core. Removed the equivalent code from the Windows OSD layer. This now relies on options being set for controlling these features by the OSD layer via options.c. Deprecated the old osd_get_fps_text() function. Changed osd_update() to take a parameter indicating whether or not the frame was skipped. Added new function osd_sleep() to the OSD core timing library [Aaron Giles].
- Properly fixed tile flipping in Mustache Boy [David Haywood].
- Updates drivers from C-E to use the newer video timing system [Zsolt Vasvari].
