Source changes:
---------------
- Improved graphics and cleaned up driver for srmp6 [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina].
- Fixed bug in model 2 polygon clipping [Ernesto Corvi].
- Fixed input port so that shadfrcj doesn't skip straight to the end sequence [stephh].
- Fixed recent changes to the MB86233 core that broke Virtua Racing [Aaron Giles].
- Added intelligence around the UPDATE_HAS_NOT_CHANGED flag, which is returned from VIDEO_UPDATE. If all screens in the game return UPDATE_HAS_NOT_CHANGED, then that frame is effectively skipped (up to 3 frames in a row) in terms of throttling. This allows games that render every other frame to not throttle during their "off frames". Updated the midvunit driver to return UPDATE_HAS_NOT_CHANGED. You should see an improvement in framerate with throttling enabled for these games. Note that this only kicks in if frameskip is set to 0 [Aaron Giles].
