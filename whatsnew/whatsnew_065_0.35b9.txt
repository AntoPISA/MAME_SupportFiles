0.35b9 1999/03/30 [#065 - Nicola Salmoria]
------------------------------------------
After the problems with the last few betas, this should be a stable release again. All games which worked before the core changes should be working again. Let us know if you find some still broken.


New Games Supported
-------------------
Gaplus [Manuel Abadia, Ernesto Corvi]
Sindbad Mystery [Nicola Salmoria, Mike Balfour]
Super Burger Time [Bryan McPhail]
Super Locomotive [Zsolt Vasvari]
Van Van Car [Allard van der Bas]
Yamato (preliminary) [Nicola Salmoria]

New Clones Supported
--------------------
Crazy Climber (bootleg set 2) [Zsolt Vasvari]
Pac Man (modified) [Allard van der Bas]


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Converted the System 16 drivers to use the TileMap system - they are now cleaner, faster, and support screen rotation [Phil Stroffolino].
- Fixed background in Pig Newton [Mike Balfour].
- Fixed the Galaxian-style starfield. Believe it or not, it had been broken since day 1 [Nicola Salmoria].


Source changes:
----------------------
- Emulated the protection in Jump Bug (Rock-ola). Some ROM splitup too, and fixed colors [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed hangs in Super Real Darwin when big bosses come, however the order they appear in is likely wrong (it's a protection issue). If you know the correct order, contact mish@tendril.force9.net [Bryan McPhail].
- [DOS] New tweaked 256x256 VGA modes (both scanlines and noscanlines) stretched to fill the screen. They are automatically used for horizontal games, and are preferable to the -stretch option since they are faster. You might have to adjust your monitor settings to make them properly centered and fill the screen (use the border displayed on startup as a guideline) [Valerio Verrando].
- Added default strings for dip switches. For example, instead of "Cabinet", use DEF_STR( Cabinet ). The constants are defined in inptport.h [Nicola Salmoria].
- Redesigned the struct InputPort to use less space, and changed how analog inputs are defined. An additional benefit is that the keys for digital emulation of analog inputs are now defined in the Keys for this Game menu, together with all other keys, instead that in the Analog Controls menu. The Analog Controls menu remains to set the other parameters [Nicola Salmoria].
- The debugger is almost complete [Juergen Buchmueller].
