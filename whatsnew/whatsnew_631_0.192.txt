  * Reformatted the game drivers to be more readable.
- fmtowns: Fixed kanji ROM offset calculation and scrolling in 16-color mode [r09]:
  * Kanji in fixed ROM font now displays correctly, making boot messages intelligible.
  * Scrolling imperfect but better than before - fixes scrolling/positioning issues in multiple games.
- hcd62121 updates [Ricardo Barreira]:
  * Made improvements based on experiments with hardware using a CFX-9850G.
  * Fixed mistakes in CL flag calculations, and added more unknown instructions.
  * CFX-9850G is now emulated just accurately enough for most of the RUN mode to work well.
- mrisc: Added PROM dumps and removed the ARM boot hack [RolandLangfeld, Sandro Ronco].
- arm7: Added rudimentary instruction prefetch buffer. Fixes GBA NES Classics games [Ryan Holtz].
- gba: Made GPIO ports pass ROM through on read by default - fixes Doom 2 and Duke Nukem Advance [Ryan Holtz].
- e132xs: Reworked all opcodes to reduce runtime branches and unnecessary work - now considerably faster [Ryan Holtz].
- sm7238: Implemented reverse video, 80/132 column switching, and alternate font [shattered].
- vt240: Fixed palette and screen size fix [shattered].
- monty.cpp: Wake Monty Plays Scrabble and Master Monty from HALT instruction using reset [smf].
- z80: Implemented HALT output and clear HALT condition during reset [smf].
- c65 updates [smf]:
  * Reordered keys and renamed I/O ports to match system specification.
  * Added caps key and two extra keyboard columns, although only one of them may have made it into hardware.
  * Added support for switching between 40/80 columns with F1 and blink/underline/highlight/reverse attribute.
  * Allow switching between upper case/lower case character ROM with shift+Commodore key.
- chdman: Use DeviceIoControl to get disk length - allows chdman to access physical drives on Windows 10 [Ted Green].
- Added 32- and 64-bit population count utilities [Vas Crabb].
- Moved object finder resolution before device_start (github #2759) [Vas Crabb].
- Added an SDLC consumer device that logs SNA frame headers and data [Vas Crabb].
- Replaced hacky Kaypro keyboard that bypassed the SIO with emulated Kaypro 10 keyboard [Vas Crabb, rfka01, TeamEurope].
- kaypro: Switched from z80dart to z80sio, hooked up BRG to SIOs, hooked up direct connections from SIOs to RS232 ports [Vas Crabb].
- z80sio updates [Vas Crabb]:
  * Decoupled from device_serial_interface - it can't support synchronous modes, on-the-fly register updates, and other features.
  * Made asynchronous receive behave more like real device: check that start bit persists for half a bit interval, sample data bits mid-interval, handle invalid stop bit as described in Zilog manual, check parity and latch overrun and parity errors.
  * Re-implemented break detection.
  * Implemented SDLC transmission including bit stuffing, transmit CRC, abort, and underrun/end-of-message behaviour.
  * Generalised synchronous transmission to other modes.
  * Completely overhauled interrupt logic - vectors should be correct now.
  * Improved handling of transmit and receive buffers and control lines.
  * Implemented different auto-reset receive errors in MPSC vs SIO.
  * Implemented enough of synchronous reception to pass uts20 loopback tests (not accurate, but helps understanding).
  * Disabled automatic CRC transmission in 1-byte sync mode (necessary to pass uts20 loopback tests).
- e132xs: Templated most Hyperstone register-register and immediate opcode handlers to reduce code duplication. Also fixed behaviour in some corner cases including privileged register traps and SR as source in subtraction [Vas Crabb].
- uts20 updates - all self-tests now pass without ROM patches [Vas Crabb]:
  * Hacked in permanent loopback on SIO channel A TxD to RxD, and SIO channel B TxD to RxD and WAIT/READY to DCD+RTS.
  * Implement parity poison and NMI on parity error feature.
  * Corrected NVRAM width to four bits.

- namcos10.cpp: Updated documentation [Guru].
