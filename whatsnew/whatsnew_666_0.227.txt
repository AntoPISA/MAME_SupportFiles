-fm7.cpp: Second cleanup pass [AJR]
 * Eliminate RAM regions
 * Eliminate device_timer and anonymous timer usage
 * Add bad dump flags for hardware-inaccurate ROM dumps
 * Add NO_DUMP entries for a few minor missing parts
 * Remove a lot of dead code

-ceres: wip checkpoint [Patrick Mackinlay]
 * implement the mouse
 * connect the fpu
 * crude hard/floppy disk controller hle
 * add debugger rom
 * boots oberon from hard disk image

-emumem: Simplify memory management [O. Galibert].
 * API impact:
   - install_ram/rom/writeonly now requires a non-null pointer.  If you want automatically managed ram, add it to a memory map, not
      in machine_start
   - install_*_bank now requires a memory_bank *, not a string
   - one can create memory banks outside of memory maps with memory_bank_creator
   - one can create memory shares outside of memory maps with memory_share_creator
     * Memory maps impact:
   - RAM ranges with overlapping addresses are not shared anymore.  Use .share()
   - RAM ranges touching each other are not merged anymore.  Stay in your range
     * Extra note:
   - there is no need to create a bank just to dynamically map some memory/rom. Just use install_rom/ram/writeonly

    only find 100 occurrences of a string and don't actually give you the full raw log when you ask for it, it's going to take
    several passes to catch all of these.

-hp3478a: layout: LCD annunciators, button labels [fenugrec]

-Fairly significant overhaul of Lua engine and some cleanup [Vas Crabb].
 * The things that were previously called device iterators are not iterators in the C++ sense of the word.  This is confusing for
    newcomers.  These have been renamed to be device enumerators.
 * Several Lua methods and properties that previously returned tables now return lightweight wrappers for the underlying objects.
    This means creating them is a lot faster, but you can't modify them, and the performance characteristics of different operations
    varies.
 * The render manager's target list uses 1-based indexing to be more like idiomatic Lua.
 * It's now possible to create a device enumerator on any device, and then get subdevices (or sibling devices) using a relative tag.
 * Much more render/layout functionality has been exposed to Lua.  Layout scripts now have access to the layout file and can
    directly set the state of an item with no bindings, or register callbacks to obtain state.  Some things that were previously
    methods are now read-only properties.
 * Layout files are no longer required to supply a "name".  This was problematic because the same layout file could be loaded for
    multiple instances of the same device, and each instance of the layout file should use the correct inputs (and in the future
    outputs) for the device instance it's associated with.
 * This should also fix video output with MSVC builds by avoiding delegates that return things that don't fit in a register.

 * Got more UI code out of the input manager.

-support Redump extended bin/cue format for Dreamcast discs (#7422) [nhand42]
 * initial check-in of Redump bin/cue support for Dreamcast GDI
 * correctly identifies multi-cue format and sets GDROM flags
 * creates a working Crazy Taxi chd from a Redump bin/cue
 * disabled debugging code and started tidying up
 * simple tool to compare chdman bin/cue and bin/gdi conversions, should be identical

-st2302u: Add logging stubs for unknown registers [AJR]

-st2205u, st2302u: Improve DMA; add multiplicator [AJR]

-More Lua engine clean-up and documentation, resulting in core cleanup [Vas Crabb].
 * More Lua interface cleanup, additional properties and methods, and documentation migration/expansion.
 * Emulated switch inputs can have "not" codes applied to host input axis directions.  It works the same way as host switch inputs -
    push twice for a "not" prefix.
 * Input polling helpers no longer need to store state in the input device items.  There’s less leakage, and less chance of things
    interfering with each other.
 * Allow snapshot view options to be configured through the internal UI via the video options menu.  Made video options menus place
    initial focus on the currently selected view item.  Removed some crud from the menu base class.
 * Fixed the description of the "snapview" option.  The value to get raw screen pixels was changed to "native" a long time ago but
    the description was never updated.
 * Re-arranged the Golden Poker button lamps so that the 6-button layouts for Jolli Witch and Wild Witch make sense.  In 6-button
    mode, the hold buttons double as bonus game and bet buttons, but the lamp outputs don't change.  The simplest way to deal with
    this without requiring the user to switch views or using layout scripting is to place the dedicated buttons directly below the
    hold buttons that correspond to them.
 * Removed some software list data that was redundantly copied into device_image_interface (m_supported was never even set, so it
    didn't even work), and made crc() work better (previously it wasn't recalculuated after unloading and loading another image).
 * Made strformat.h and devcb.h play nicer with C++17 and pre-standard C++20.  Format precision now correctly limits the length of
    string views.  Confirmed that strformat.{h,cpp} works with pre-standard C++20 support in GCC 9.
 * Removed an auto_alloc from cpu/arm7.

-slapstic: Some more information [Olivier Galibert]

 that it uses ROM revision 9004A. [Andy Welburn]

      500,000 points, instead of 300,000 points when toggled off.

-ibm5170.xml: Fix spelling, standardize on "de" for Germany [Justin Kerk]

-Fix some oversights and emergent behaviour with view selection [Vas Crabb].
 * Exposed the "native snapview" option on the video manager.  Trying to use presence of a single view is a poor proxy that breaks
    with multi-screen systems.
 * Allow rotation to be changed for native snapshot views, and disable the zoom to screen area control when it has no effect on the
    selected view.
 * Treat an empty string identically to "auto" for view selectction. Previously this was being used for prefix matching so it would
    force the first view.  (This caused the bad snapshot view selection.  It had been relying on "internal" not being a common view
    name prefix so it fell through to automatic selection, but when changed to an empty string it forced the first view.)
 * Documented "auto" as well as "native" for the -snapview option and changed the default to auto rather than an empty string for
    consistency with the -viewN options.
 * Added [w]string_view handlers to the stuff that's instantiated in strformat.cpp since we'll be increasingly using them.
 * Cleaned up and updated some documentation.

    properties for better control over snapshots.
