Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed most of the remaining issues with Taito F3 sound [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * Sound in Ring Rage and Riding Fight still doesn't work.
  * Quiz Theater has a bad sound rom.
  * Bust-A-Move Again (US) sound roms need checking again real (non-conversion) cart.
- Improvements in the Microprose 3D driver [Philip J Bennett]:
  * Games not playable, but still a big improvement over the skeleton driver.
- Improvements to MACs driver [Tomasz Slanina]:
  * Now using ST0016 Video, however emulation is still incomplete so it doesn't do much more yet.
- Improvements to Hyperstone based drivers [Tomasz Slanina].
- Added missing PROMs to many drivers [HIGHWAYMAN].
- Fixed Vs. Goonies Dips [chaneman].
- Lethal Enforcers Improvements [R. Belmont]:
  Fixes:
  * Tilemap colors.
  * Guns hooked up and aligned properly.
  * Tilemap and sprite layers aligned with the guns.
  * Various other cleanups - added a sprite ROM that was missing previously.
  To do:
  * Figure out the correct sprite decode.
  * Sprite/tilemap priorities.
  * "Reload" indicator is funky, probably needs tilemap flip bits.
  * Fix K056832 external linescroll RAM support (used for high scores, parallax in scrolling stages).
- Misc changes [Nathan Woods]:
  * Added a hook that allows a driver to install a custom read handler for reading interrupt vectors (the 65816 has a signal that is asserted  when reading a vector and certain hardware needs to reroute the read).
  * Created a memory_get_op_ptr() call.  This call is equivalent to memory_get_read_ptr() in ADDRESS_SPACE_PROGRAM with the exception that it is aware of the opbase handler. 
  * Modified debugger to use memory_get_op_ptr() to determine if opcode memory is unmapped. 
- Misc compiler fixes [Lawrence Gold]:
  * Taito SJ update [Nicola Salmoria].
  * Added sound CPU -> main CPU communication (fixes Tin Star hangs without need for a kludge, and makes tunes between levels correctly play until the end).
  * Added memory map derived from schematics
  * Added DAC volume control (I hear little difference, even if it's used).
  * Coin lockout (important otherwise games could accept more than 9 coins).
- Correct Hyperstone Iram mirroring [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added real noise generator to TMS5110 [Jarek Burczynski].
- Workaround for Dipswitch problem in Mr Do's Castle [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed bug in M37710 cpu core [R. Belmont].
- More Sega improvements, including lots of set renaming and cleaning up of drivers by removing unused code [Aaron Giles].
- Updated some mahjong drivers to use the new standard inputs. Note, there was a further submission, this will need resyncing and resubmitting [James Wallace].
- PSX based driver improvments [smf]:
  * New board notes from Guru.
  * Removed 8.3 restrictions on namco system 11 ROM names.
  * Improved root counter emulation.
  * Improved dma acknowledge emulation.
  * Changes visible area immediately instead of during video update.
- Hooked up sound cpu in fitfight.c [Tomasz Slanina].
- Misc compiler fixes for VC [Bryan McPhail].
- Sound in Minesweeper driver [Frank Palazzolo].

... and probably a whole bunch of other bits and pieces I've forgotten to mention (the WIP updates might give a better overview).
 Anything that is missing will probably need resubmitting after Aaron's changes.
