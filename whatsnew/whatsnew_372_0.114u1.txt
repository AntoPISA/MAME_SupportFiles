Source changes:
---------------
- Added actual emulation of the microcontroller used for the Namco 50xx chip as found in 'Bosconian' and 'Xevious' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added debug attribute to the XML output [Firewave].
- Added DIP locations to the mario, mrdo, sheriff, and spacefb drivers [Justin Szczap].
- Added skeleton driver for Dreamcast-based systems [Aaron Giles].
- Added skeleton driver for Konami Viper system [Ville Linde].
- Added very preliminary SH4 CPU core [R. Belmont].
- Fixed bug that caused video glitches when frameskipping due to using out of sync textures [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed crash in playch10 driver when run standalone [Curt Coder].
- Fixed crash with multithreaded rendering and the graphics viewer [Couriersud].
- Fixed internal timer counting in the TMS32025 core. This makes the music in 'Cool Pool' and '9 Ball Shootout' bearable [Aaron Giles].
- Got the Hang Pilot driver working. The analog controls are still missing, however, so it's still marked as non-working [Ville Linde].
- Improved the NWK-TR driver to get Thrill Drive mostly working [Ville Linde].
- In the COp420 core, fixed the XABR opcode, added LBI skip for extended opcodes, and fixed the CPU name in save states. Added GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE flag to the Cidelsa games. Draco still has no sound though [Curt Coder].
- Substantially changed the TMS340x0 interfaces to allow the CPU emulator to directly manage the video screen. Glitches in several games are now fixed as a result (for example the flashing screens in NBA Jam are now gone at last) [Aaron Giles].
- Updated video timing in the Sega System 16, Hang On, Out Run, and X-Board games according to measurements from the boards [Aaron Giles].
