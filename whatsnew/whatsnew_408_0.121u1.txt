New Clones Added
----------------
Fighting Soccer (version 4) [Corrado Tomaselli]
Stadium Cross (US) [Arzeno Fabrice]


Source changes:
---------------
- Added an API to access the current amiga_machine_interface [Nathan Woods].
- Added explicit Core2 architecuture support to the makefile (CORE2=1). Note that gcc 4.2.0 doesn't understand core 2, so this is equivalent to compiling with pentium-m architecture and -sse3. Also note that compiling native on a Core2 is not what you want because native will think you are on a Prescott, which is P4-era hardware [Aaron Giles].
- Added more static qualifiers to core files [Atari Ace].
- Changed alignment of rgbint values in the namcos22 driver to work around 32-bit gcc's lack of proper alignment handling [Aaron Giles].
- Changed malloc tracking to be decided at runtime in a function use_malloc_tracking(). This makes it easy to turn it on or off by recompiling only a single file [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed attotime routines to use unsigned math for multiply/divide, solving problems with some games which errantly passed in -1 for the factor. The new behavior matches the original behavior [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed reversed clock speeds in mexico86 [Brian Troha].
- Optimized the hyperstone core, gaining ~50% speed improvement in most games. Implemented clock prescaling and corrected interrupt priority handling. Then fixed the clock speeds on the most of the games and killed most of the speed gains in quite a number of them (Sorry!) [Aaron Giles].
- Renamed colortable to colortable_t. Added a Machine->colortable entry to hold the global colortable for games that use it. Updated several more drivers to just use palettes directly rather than hacking colortables [Aaron Giles].
- Split up MSVC inline assembler functions into MSVC specific headers, and removed the assumption that Window's osinline.h would only be used by MSVC [Nathan Woods].
