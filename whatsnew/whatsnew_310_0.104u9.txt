Source changes:
---------------
- Added decryption of kof2003 p3 ROM [iq_132].
- Changed comment prefix in debugger command scripts from '#' to '//' [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed makefile to allow command-line override of MAMEOS and TARGET variables [smf, Aaron Giles].
- Fixed gsword, which was broken in an earlier update [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Cleaned up error logging so that it is callback driven, allowing more than one potential output source. Fixed the -oslog option in the Windows build [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed "do" command in the debugger [Aaron Giles].
- Had to undo the use of timers to trigger save/restore of states. This leads to one less timer in the system, and hence will break the save states from previous versions. The current save state system is extremely sensitive to such changes, unfortunately. This will be addressed in a future version [Aaron Giles].
