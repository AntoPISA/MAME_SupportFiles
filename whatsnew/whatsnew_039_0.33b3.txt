These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- All drivers with a handcrafted palette got broken in beta 2. They are now fixed.
- Better colors in 'Side Pocket' [Marc Vergoossen].
- Accurate (?) colors in 'Fast Freddie'/'Fly-Boy' [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Accurate colors in 'Jump Coaster' [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed colors in 'Road Runner' [Aaron Giles].
- The 'Gauntlet' drivers are now color-reduced (faster & better) [Aaron Giles].
- Accurate colors in metack and possibly the other Gameplan games [Chris Moore].
- Fixed a couple of palette problems with 'Snow Bros'. It also no longer uses a 16 bit video mode, so it's faster [nicola Salmoria].


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------
- Put back sample support in 'Q*Bert Qubes' [Rodimus Prime].
- Music in '3 Stooges' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Emulated sound in 'Lunar Lander' [Keith Wilkins].
- Sound in the Gameplan games [Chris Moore].
- Increased music tempo in 'Snow Bros' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Updated VLM5030 emulation (Punch Out etc.). Since quality is still bad, the emulator is only used when samples are not avaialble [Tatsuyuki Satoh].


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------
- 'Locomotion', 'Jungler', 'Commando' (Sega), 'Wonder Boy in Monster Land', 'Rygar', 'Gemini Wing', 'Silkworm', 'City Connection', 'Trojan', 'Up'n Down' [Dani Portillo].
- Fixed 'Diamond Run' [Mike Balfour].
- 'Front Line' [Steve Ellenoff].


Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- Another step forward in getting 'Super Punch Out' to work (still NOT playable) [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Proper emulation of the ROM decryption in Burger Time [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Improved Spy Hunter controls (you can play with the mouse or even a wheel now) [Alex Judd].
- Changed the 6502 emulation to disable interrupts on a reset. Not sure if this is the correct behaviour, but Centipede needed it for the service mode to work. This was actually a change in BETA 1 which I forgot to mention [Nicola Salmoria].
- New -listdetails option, to create a detailed list of drivers and the hardware they use [Mirko Buffoni].


Source changes:
----------------
- Fixed bug in the 6809 disassembler [Keith Wilkins].
