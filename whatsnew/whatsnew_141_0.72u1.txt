Source changes:
---------------
- Changed Fuuki 16-bit driver to use Partial Updates for Raster Effects and enabled them [David Haywood, Paul Priest].
- Temporary fixes to a few of the System 16 driver problems (sound banking for example). Note, the driver is still being rewritten these are only minor 'fixes' to improve things a bit until the rewrite is complete [Acho A. Tang].
- Change so DIP menu isn't displayed if no Dipswitches are defined in the driver instead of flashing a blank mneu when you try and enter it [Paul Priest].
- Various changes [Nathan Woods]:
  * Fixed a bug in the NORMI opcode;
  * Removed use of the GCC specific varargs on macros feature;
  * Changed around one of the #include paths (due to ProjectBuilder on Mac issues);
  * Added support for the TMS0285 variant (an old variant of the TMS5220);
  * Added support for the SRCSHADE and DSTA2 command bits to the Jaguar blitter;
  * Added some miscellaneous logging code;
  * Changed around one of the #include paths (due to ProjectBuilder on Mac issues);
  * Added support for objects with pitch != 1 for objects with 1-2 bits per pixels;
  * Added a function to retrieve the interface;
  * Added a MESS specific UI string (within #ifdef MESS of course);
  * Parameterized the setDIP switches() call; so that a menu that looks like the DIP switch menu can easily be made with different IPT_* values (MESS has a configuration menu that functions a lot like the DIP *switch menu);
  * Small fix to allow the UI to be drawn if the artwork system is active but no artwork is present (not an issue for MAME);
  * Cleanup and fix of set_ea_info() so that negative offsets of 8 or 16 bits do not have extraneous FF's in front of them;
  * More proper fix to the scanline display bug that prevented registers from being edited when the scanline display was on;
  * Better message for when invalid opcodes are disassembled;
  * Fixed crashing bug with clones;
  * Adds some MESS specific IPT defaults (within #ifdef MESS);
  * Modified input_port_allocate() so that PORT_BITX declarations that specify JOYCODE_a_BUTTONb for their default codes will also get JOYCODE_MOUSE_a_BUTTONb or'd in;
  * Added seq_set_4() and seq_set_5();
  * Changed render_frame() so that throttle_speed() will also be called when game_is_paused is set. This prevents MAME from busy looping   *when paused.
