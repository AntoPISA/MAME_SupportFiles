Acknoledgements
---------------
First of all, thanks to Allard van der Bas (avdbas@wi.leidenuniv.nl) for starting the Arcade Emulation Programming Repository at http://valhalla.ph.tn.tudelft.nl/emul8, without the Repository, I would never have even tried to write an emulator. If you find out something useful, submit it to avdbas@wi.leidenuniv.nl, so it will be made available to everybody on the Repository page.

Usage
-----

MAME [name of the game to run] [options]

for example

MAME mspacman -nosound   will run Ms Pac Man without sound

options:
-vesa         use standard 640x480x256 VESA mode instead of custom video mode
-noscanlines  use alternate video mode (not availble in all games)
-nosound      turn off sound
-nojoy        don't poll joystick
-log          create a log of illegal memory accesses in ERROR.LOG


The following keys work in all emulators:

3       Insert coin
1       Start 1 player game
2       Start 2 players game
Tab     Change dip switch settings
P       Pause
F3      Reset
F11     Activate fps counter
F12     Save a screen snapshot
ESC     Exit emulator



Pac Man, Ms Pac Man
-------------------
Arrows  Move around
F1      Skip level
F2      Test mode
CTRL    Speed up cheat

Known issues:
- Blinky and Pinky seem to be shifted one pixel to the right. This is really annoying, but I can't seem to be able to understand why. Maybe here s an additional "sprite offset" register somewhere? Or did the original just behave this way?
  Note that we can't fix it by just moving sprites 0 and 1 one pixel to the left, because when Pac Man eats a power pill the sprites order is changed so that Pac Man is drawn over the ghosts. It becomes sprite 0, and Blinky becomes sprite 4.

Crush Roller
------------
Crush Roller is a hacked version of Make Trax, modified to run on a Pac Man board.

Arrows  Move around
F1      Skip level

Known issues:
- There's the same problem with sprites as in Pac Man, but here it could be fixed without apparent side effects.

Pengo
-----
Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Push
F1      Skip level
F2      Test mode

Lady Bug
--------
Arrows  Move around
F1      Skip level

Known issues:
- The noise generator is not emulated yet.
