0.86u2 2004/08/31 [#200 - David Haywood]
----------------------------------------
Quick update but since there have been some large submissions I feel it is worthwhile.


New Clones Added or Promoted from GAME_NOT_WORKING status
---------------------------------------------------------
Street Fighter EX 2 Plus (USA) [Brian Troha]
D&D Tower of Doom (alt Japan set) [Razoola]

New Non-Working games / clones supported
----------------------------------------
Roads Edge / Round Trip
Samurai Shodown: Warrior's Rage
Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition (Hyper Neogeo 64 based, these need more complete MMU emulation in the MIPS core amongst other things, driver is still only preliminary)
