Source changes:
--------------
- Amiga core system updates [Ernesto Corvi]:
  * Updated 6526/8520 CIA to be able to set the value of the SP pin. This is needed to emulate the Amiga keyboard.
  * Updated the custom chips emulation to delay for about 24 cycles the issuing of interrupts after a write to INTENA or INTREQ. 
  * Fixed a bug where if INTREQ got cleared programatically, it would 'forget' about pending CIA interrupts, causing the CIA to stop sending further interrupts.
  * Fixed the interrupt delay logic. Now it properly delays firing the irqs, not the masking/disabling.
  * Fixed return value for unused/invalid custom registers reads.
  * Added Denise ID custom register to properly identify OCS, ECS and AGA.
  * Added reset to custom, autoconfig and cia when a RESET opcode is found.
  * Resetting the custom chips will now clear INTENA, preventing further interrupts.
  * Fixed a bug in the RBF interrupt request code check.
  * Fixed a bug on the 6526/8520 CIA that prevented chained counters from working.
  * Added support for the 'blitter-nasty' bit on the blitter. Fixes many games that displayed wrong graphics.
- Hooked up coin counter in Gun Fight. Also connected sounds properly per schematics. Added proper watchdogs to invaders and invad2ct [Derrick Renaud].
- Added missing initialization to the TMS5220 RNG [Lord Nightmare].
- Taito JC driver improvements [Ville Linde]:
  * Implemented MC68HC11 communications.
  * Added analog controls via MC68HC11.
  * Various bug fixes and some new opcodes to the TMS320C51 core.
  * Moved video hardware emulation to vidhrdw/taitojc.c.
  * Implemented 3D hardware emulation.
- Cleaned up the 8080bw sound changes included with u1 [Robbbert].
- Changed 6532riot and tia code to only allow initialization at init time [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed several bugs in the old System 16 bootleg code [Mamesick].
- Fixed SIM opcode in i8085 emulator [Tomasz Slanina].
- Initial support for Unicode in the core and Windows OSD [Nathan Woods]:
  * Text file reading/writing now automatically handle UTF-8 conversion.
  * A number of Windows functions internally manage TCHARs.
  * New Windows compile-time option UNICODE can be used to build MAME as a Unicode application (see windows.mak).
- Added new visible representation of physical DIP switches for drivers that have them defined. To see this, just pull up the DIP switch menu on drivers that have been documented [Brian Oberholtzer].
- Corrected some incorrect DIP switch information in the 1942, toaplan2, and segag80r drivers [Brian Oberholtzer].
- Added the remaining MESS CPU cores to MAME. They are disabled in the build, but will be maintained along with the MAME CPU cores as future changes are made [Nathan Woods].
- Added support for multiple instances of the samples sound system [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Converted input port definitions from code-based constructors to data-driven tokenized values. This reduces the overall MAME code size by a significant amount. Note that the tokenization is a bit different for 32-bit versus 64-bit builds, so hopefully somebody with a 64-bit system can verify that it works (mame -listxml should produce identical results to the 32-bit version) [Atari Ace, Aaron Giles].
- Properly implemented sound interrupts in 'Night Slashers' [Aaron Giles].
- Improved cycle timings in the ARM CPU core. Altered the deco32 CPU clocks to be more realistic [Aaron Giles].
- Updated copyright dates in header files and docs [Aaron Giles].
