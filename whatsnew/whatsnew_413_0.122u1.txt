Source changes:
---------------
- Zeus updates [Aaron Giles]:
  * Added backface culling which mostly works but fails sometimes, so it is disabled.
  * Changed rendering code to allow for greater parallelism on multicore systems.
  * Cleaned up zeus wave RAM accessors.
  * Extracted data for lights.
  * Figured out data format of 2 matrix form.
  * Fixed invasn lightgun offset.
  * Made right/bottom vertices inclusive to fix some gapping issues.
  * Reduced visible area to remove artifacts.
  * Removed some vestigial zeus 2 hacks.
  * Started on some initial lighting calculations.
- Zeus 2 hardware [Aaron Giles]:
  * Fixed default screen parameters to match the games.
  * Fixed digital inputs for crusnexo.
  * Fixed ROM loading, added banking support.
  * Hooked up ZPRAM.
  * Implemented direct pixel accesses; enough to get startup screens to show.
  * Separated zeus 2 video implementation from zeus implementation.
- Afega/nmk16 cleanups [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina]:
  * Fixed a number of games.
  * Merged afega.c and nmk16.c drivers.
  * Removed many hacks from both.
- Fixed C219 sample read order and implemented sign+magnitude format. Removed GAME_IMPERFECT_SOUND flag from all Namco NA-1 games [Philip Bennett].
- Fixed ROM-based DCS2 system to ignore HLE transfers (Fixes broken sound in invasn). Properly reduced internal memory on the ADSP-2104 variants [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug that would cause events to leak through to the game when the debugger was up [Aaron Giles].
- Verified some cpu clocks of original boards using a frequency counter [Corrado Tomaselli]:
  * Besides confirming clocks on some games, I modified:
  * Changed Halley Comet main cpu clock to 1.664mhz (it's not a mistake, the clock is very low).
  * Changed Pang M6295 clock from 990khz to 1Mhz.
  * Changed Success Joe Ym2203 clock from 3mhz to 4mhz.
  * Aerofighters and Turbo Force sound z80 to 5mhz.
  * Midnight Resitance 68k cpu to 10mhz (20mhz crystal) and modified m6295 clock to 1mhz. Also confirmed pin 7 is high. (Midnight resistance has a lot of slow downs on the pcb too).
- Minor "code quality" improvements [Atari Ace]:
  * A few global names were modified to make them less generic/more consistent (voodoo.c, vrender0.c, lethal.c, rungun.c, zac2650.c).
  * Fixed some missing #include "foo.h".
  * Fixed some remaining static/const qualifier missed cases.
  * Some dead/useless code was removed (i8051.c,model1.c,romcmp.c).
