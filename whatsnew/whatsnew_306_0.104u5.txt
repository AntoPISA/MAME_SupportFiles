---------------------------------------
IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: a new function osd_create_directory is now required in order to create memcard subdirectories. This function was previously defined only for the MESS core, so if there is a MESS port already available, you can just import that function.

Source changes:
---------------
- Hooked up missing language jumper in the Psikyo 4 games [David Haywood].
- Added board notes to the Namco System 12 driver, hooked up the light gun in Ghouls Panic/Point Blank 2, and emulated Tekken Tag Tournament DMA protection (still not playable) [Olivier Galibert, Duddie, smf].
- Fixed old debugger compilation on non-Windows platforms. Added mame_strnicmp along the way [Lawrence Gold].
- Fixed compile errors under GCC 4.1 [Lawrence Gold].
- Changed the NES PPU interfaces to follow new struct conventions [Nathan Woods].
- Updated disassembly comments support [Andrew Gardner]:
  * Fixed a 0-length comment bug (no more "// 0, " allowed);
  * Added comment output to the new debugger's dasm command;
  * Changed the comment save path from /mame/comment to /mame/comments.
- Added new debugger properties: logunmap, logunmapd, logunmapi which enable/disable logging of unmapped memory accesses [Nathan Woods].
- Added save state support to the Astrocade driver [Adam Bousley].
- Some small improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver [Andrew Gardner].
- Preliminary Thumb implementation for the ARM7 core. Many opcodes present, but there are definite sign problems [Ryan Holtz].
- Hooked up ARM7 protection CPU in KOV2. Boots but does not run or play due to the Thumb sign problems [R. Belmont].
- Fixed incorrect flags emulation in the 8080 CMA instruction [Kopromaster].
- Added support for zero-length palettes (requires RGB direct mode) and several validity checks related to display variables [Nathan Woods].
- Updated windows input code [Derrick Renaud]:
  * Now using RAWMOUSE mode if available. This means you can now use multiple mice in Windows XP. Lightgun support has not been changed yet;
  * Added back DX7 support for the windows input system to support multiple mice. It was set to DX5 in 104u2;
  * Removed the system mouse from the list of available mice on non-XP systems. This allows you to now properly select the individual mouse;
  * Modified the Analog Axes selection of the player controls to be more responsive.
- Cleaned up video system in Scorpion 2 driver [El Condor].
- Converted asterix to use K056832 emulation [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Reduced encryption in Gaelco games down to equations. These still need to be optimized, but the giant encryption tables are no longer needed [Nicola Salmoria].
- Cleaned up include files in CPU/sound cores. CPU cores should generally only need to include cpuintrf.h. Sound cores should generally only need to include sndintrf.h [Atari Ace, Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug that caused a full set of validity checks even on release builds [Aaron Giles].
- New debugger features [Aaron Giles]:
  * New command "print" is a simple way to display the result of one or more expressions;
  * New command "symlist" displays all the symbols registered;
  * All save state registered scalar globals are now available as symbols (prefixed by a '.');
  * All save state registered global arrays are now available for viewing/editing in the memory window;
  * All registered memory regions are also available for viewing/editing in the memory window.
- Made it a fatal error to request operations on invalid sound/CPU indexes. These have been logged to the error.log in the past, but really need to be cleaned up. Added a new function safe_activecpu_get_pc() that can be used when logging PCs to smartly detect whether or not it is safe to call activecpu_get_pc() [Aaron Giles].
- Changed CPU init/reset callbacks. The init callback now accepts a number of parameters, including the CPU index, the clock, a generic configuration parameter, and a pointer to the IRQ callback. The reset callback no longer takes any parameters (the configuration parameter has been moved to the init callback). And the IRQ_CALLBACK getter/setter has been removed since this is now set up once at initialization time [Aaron Giles].
- Added mame_get_phase to determine which program phase (init/reset/running/exit) the system is in. This is intended primarily for assertions to enforce rules about when certain actions can be taken [Aaron Giles].
- Rewrote winalloc to be more dynamic, and to ignore memory leaks in the runtime [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed memcards properly. They are no longer hardcoded for the neogeo. The implementation has moved to generic/machine.c, and a callback handler very similar to NVRAM is now supported in the machine driver definition. Cards are created per-game, so the memcard directory now has a subfolder per game with each game's cards stored underneath [Aaron Giles].
