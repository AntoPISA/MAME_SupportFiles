MAMETesters Bugs Fixed (6):
---------------------------
- 03813: [Graphics] shadoww, shadowwa, gaiden, ryukendn, ryukendna: Lost blending effect (David Haywood)
- 00803: [Color/Palette] All vsnes.c games: Colors are wrong.
- 00270: [Graphics] cstlevna, vsgradus, suprmrio, goonies: Black startup screens are now gray.
- 00889: [Color/Palette] pc_smb: The colors of the characters, fire flower, etc. on the top screen are wrong.
- 01097: [Color/Palette] cstlevna: Colors of the first enemies you encounter are wrong.
- 02457: [DIP/Input] tkoboxng: Unable to coin/start game properly.


Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed a bug with un-inited DMA regs in the SNES driver, fixes at least a long-standing bug with nss_ssoc dimmed team selection screen [Angelo Salese].
- Added the Airline Pilot (USA) Naomi BIOS ROM [The Dumping Union].
- sauro, trckydoc, trckydoca (sauro.c): Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code) [stephh].
- ppu2c0x.c: Removed the bogus "color remap tables" in favor of external palettes containing data reverse-engineered (several years ago) from original hardware. Each vsnes set, as well as the playch10 bios, now requires one of these palettes [Alex Jackson].
- vsnes.c improvements [Alex Jackson]:
  * Moved RC2C05 PPU-based protection into the PPU itself, rather than hacking it in at the driver level;
  * After exhaustive testing, completely sorted out the "palette" DIP switches (which are actually PPU type selection) on all games that have them.  Added notes about these games in the comments;
  * Removed GAME_IMPERFECT_COLORS and GAME_WRONG_COLORS from all games, as they should all be 100% correct now;
  * Fixed coin inputs in tkoboxng. Removed IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS flag since there's no legitimate reason I can see for it. Also, fixed manufacturer and description to match the title screen;
  * Added a bit more information about the missing sets in the comments.
- Add partial 6840ptm readback support to exidy.c [Lord Nightmare].
- Convert Atari System 1 to use the 'new' TMS5220 interface [Lord Nightmare].
- Switch "Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters" to use the new TMS5220 interface [Lord Nightmare].
- snes.c: Fixed clipmasks in hires modes [Fabio Priuli].
- Fixed RTL opcode in-bank issue in the G65816 CPU core [Angelo Salese].
- sm8500d.c: Fixed disassembly of extended instructions (1A, 1B, 4F) [Oliver Stoeneberg].
- lr35902.c: Fixed possible issue when checking for enabled IRQs [Oliver Stoeneberg].
- rf5c68.c: Corrected the point at which the sample callbacks are triggered, and what channel is returned.  The interrupts are masked or enabled based on what PCM memory bank is used, rather than the physical channel that was used [Barry Rodewald].
- Converted Atari System 2 to use the 'new' TMS5220 interface. Switched TMS5220 type to 5220C [Lord Nightmare].
- Further refining of the Atari JSA speech and audio modifications. Hooked up the reset line for the ym2151 [Lord Nightmare].
- inptport.c: Fixed keyboard detection (mainly for MESS) [Fabio Priuli].
- Hooked up correct PROMs, corrected GFX ROM order and added bank select/enabled for the reels in "Treasure Island (Subsino)" [David Haywood].
- Updated "Star Wars" to use proper clocks for the tms5220 and the pokeys [Lord Nightmare].
- MASSIVE merge of TMS5110 and TMS5220 cores, TMS5220 side only so far. Much code by Jarek Burczynski merged. Lattice Filter, Multiplier, and clipping redone. TMS5220C multi-rate feature added. Now using the same LPC table file (and format, as created by Couriersud) as the TMS51xx is. Unvoiced-Voiced transitioning adjusted to match patent. Command handling redone to better match patent. Reasonably significant speech quality improvements: Separate tables for TMS5200, TMS5220 and TMS5220C are implemented, though all still need to be verified from hardware. Fixes: Garbled speech in "Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monster's Canal Mazes" is fixed, as well as some other garbled speech in game (when saying 'throwing switch' for instance). Known Regressions (being worked on): Victory fails its startup self test with an error 5, but speech works in-game [Lord Nightmare].
- Fixed victory self-test issue (FIFO must NOT be cleared on processing of a STOP frame, only on a new speak external command. victory is pedantic about this.), and in the process also fixed a bug regarding reading /READY state when not in speak external mode (the FIFO being full should NOT force /READY inactive in that case!) [Lord Nightmare].
- Fixed various SNES SRAM issues [Fabio Priuli, Angelo Salese].
- Fixed "Wai Wai Jockey Gate-In" title screen colors [Angelo Salese].
- mk3ghw (aladbl.c driver + megadriv.c) [stephh]:
  * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the M68000 code) ssgbl (ssgbl.c driver + megadriv.c);
  * Fixed stack vector so coins are now correctly handled (the game shall be fully playable now);
  * Fixed DIP switches and Inputs (after verification of the M68000 code).
- Added makefile PPC64 autodetection [Julian Sikorski].
- 6840PTM: Fixed interrupt flag behaviour and now allow fractional input clocks [Phil Bennett].
- 6850ACIA: Improved handling of /CTS signal and fixed issue with transmission parity generation [Phil Bennett].
- MPU4+Video updates [Phil Bennett, David Haywood]:
 * Fixed serial comms. As a result, most games actually boot now;
 * Fixed colours;
 * Fixed SAA1099 sound;
 * Added Characteriser tables for all games (a complete implementation is still needed for most games).
- Supported the 1555 fb format in the Naomi driver, needed by "Cleopatra Fortune Plus" [David Haywood].
- Fixed ext latch behaviour in the SNES driver [Angelo Salese].
- vmetal, vmetaln (vmetal.c driver): Fixed DIP switches and inputs (after verification of the M68000 code) [stephh].
- Fix 5220C pitch table so unvoiced speech actually works. Oops. Should be a further quality improvement [Lord Nightmare].
- Tentative fix for tms5220 VSM support [Lord Nightmare].
- f8 CPU disassembler improvements [Curt Coder]:
  * Fixed branch target PC;
  * Added BP,BC,BZ,BR,BM,BNC,BNZ,BNO mnemonics;
  * Removed extraneous $ from 2 byte hex values.
- Implemented various PVR TA registers hook-ups in the Naomi driver [Angelo Salese].
- mpu4drvr.c: Fixed 68000 device resets [Phil Bennett].
- Naomi: Implemented more regs, test mode now properly sets 640x240 resolution. Implemented fb pixel double, Naomi test mode looks now correct [Angelo Salese].
- i386dasm.c: Corrected display of debug registers (D0-D7) in disassembly listings [Barry Rodewald].
- video/nemesis.c: Removed palette gamma hack [Alex Jackson].
- Subsino driver improvements [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added another Treasure Island set;
  * Added technical notes about the CPU box;
  * Minor clean-ups;

- Full schematics made from the real PCB connections. They include Hex D-type flip-flops, Bipolar PROM, 3-STATE Octal D-Type latches and resnet connections [Roberto Fresca, Aleksandar Spasojevic].
- Partly implemented 'stereo' gating (using ym2151 ctX lines) to POKEY and TMS5220 on Atari JSA-i sound board (currently it is just 'mono' gating). Add TODOs for complete stereo gating and for the low-pass filter [Lord Nightmare].
- Improvements to Funworld driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Replaced the Fun World Quiz bad ROMs with good ones;
  * Fixed the Fun World Quiz graphics and colors;
  * Cleaned-up the flags for non working games;
  * Modified the default lamps layout to include the bet lamp;
  * Cleaned-up the Fun World Quiz inputs;
  * Added 4 new Royal Card sets. Reworked parent/clone relationship (delete the old .cfg and .nv files to have them working properly);
  * Splitted the Royal Card machine driver. This is needed to access different halves of the bipolar PROM;
  * Now principal Royal Card sets have a working bet button;
  * Added default NVRAM to the new sets.
- Improved video rendering in MPU4 [David Haywood].
- Implemented 15/31 kHz selector in the Naomi driver, makes "Strike Fighter" and "Shootout Pool Prize" to be bootable by the common user [Angelo Salese].
- Clean up interpolation inhibit logic, may sound slightly better now. Minor fix to TMS5220C table so zero-energy frames are correctly detected [Lord Nightmare].
- Added driver data class and save states to playmark.c, powerbal.c, pushman.c and pzletime.c [Fabio Priuli].

  * Added coin/keyin/keyout counters;
  * Added main game and double-up rates DIP switches;
  * Added minimum bet DIP switches;
  * Added maximum bet DIP switches;
  * Added complete coinage and remote credits DIP switches;
  * Added jokers and demo sounds DIP switches;
  * Figured out and documented all the game outputs;
  * Created proper button-lamps layout;
  * Now the game is in full-working state.
- Added a RAM mirror that fixes The Typing of the Dead booting [Angelo Salese].
