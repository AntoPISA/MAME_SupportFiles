Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed various problems introduced in the last set of changes [Aaron Giles, Nathan Woods, Ville Linde].
- Fixed dip-switches in Action Fighter [Chaneman].
- Improved samples support for Congo Bongo [Chris Law].
- Some improvements imported from MAME Plus!:
  * Added save state support to pd4990a device for neogeo;
  * Fixed crash in nitrobal/gunball (stage 4, right route) [xvi].
- Got 'Polygonet Warriors' back to the POST screen [Andrew Gardner].
- Reduced global namespace pollution by marking many global functions explicitly static, especially in the CPU cores [Atari Ace, Aaron Giles].
- Some improvements to 'Magical Error'. Title and attract works. No sound. Hangs in game. Problems with shared mem and main-sub cpu communciation [Tomasz Slanina].
- Added validity checks to ensure CPU core completeness [Nathan Woods].
- Added DIP switches for 'Agress' [Roberto Fresca].
- Added the missing commands and proper maker/device ids to the flash memory handlers for Fujitsu MBM29F016A, used by 'Konami FireBeat' [Ville Linde].
- Added preliminary support for the Jaleco color blending hardware found in 'Psychic 5', 'Argus', and 'Valtric'. Some functionality is still unknown [Andrew Gardner].
- Major update to the Aleck64 driver. Still not fully working yet [Ville Linde].
- Fixed comment display for processors which use an ADDRBUS_SHIFT [Andrew Gardner].

- Added movie recording time to the internal profiler [Nathan Woods].
- Added oversampling support to the Exidy custom sound and to the DAC sound system [Aaron Giles].
- Sega vector game updates [Aaron Giles]:
  * Rewrote vector generator from schematics. Yes, it is supposed to be that jumpy on zooms!
  * Corrected CPU speeds and cleaned up memory maps;
  * Connected AY-8912 to 'Zektor' for missing sound effects;
  * Added emulation of the Universal Sound Board - not yet perfected, but gets rid of the need for samples in Star Trek and Tac/Scan. Tac/Scan sounds pretty wretched now, but Star Trek is close;
  * Fixed CPU clock speed on the speech board, but it appears to be a bit too slow now;
  * This is still work-in-progress. Don't report bugs yet.
