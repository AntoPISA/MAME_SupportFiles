Source changes:

- [DOS] Added a header to .inp files (same as MAME32). With the additional header, the user no longer needs to specify the game name when playing back .inp recordings [Mike Haaland].
- Added the ability to show the total number of colors on screen. This is useful during development to know if a game can be shrinked to 256 colors or it requires a 16-bit display. Press CTRL+F11 to toggle the display. This is only available in debug builds [Nicola Salmoria].
- H6280 emulator, used by several DECO games [Bryan McPhail].
- Merged the old and new Namco sound subssytem, and added support for stereo output [Aaron Giles].
- The TileMap code is now mature enough to be used in new drivers. For examples, look into gng, gaiden, travrusa [Phil Stroffolino].
