Source changes:
---------------
- Deprecated device_set_info. Almost all devices had a NULL or empty function here. Remaining devices have been converted to have device-specific functions to do the same thing with proper type checking. CPUs still have a set_info function but it is CPU-specific now and no longer piggybacks on the general device function [Aaron Giles].
- Changed UI to ignore selection from lightguns when off screen. This stops selection of Gun X Gun Y if you move the gun out of range [Derrick Renaud].
- Moved stv_vdp2_dynamic_res_change() function outside of VIDEO_UPDATE in ST-V [Angelo Salese].
- Memory map merging for the NMK16 driver and cleaned-up some unneeded video code [Angelo Salese].

  * Disabled the floor stuff in Fatal Fury Wild Ambition (looking for a cleaner implementation).
  * Disabled zooming code for the same reasons (it was causing many issues).

  * Reorganized graphic decoding.
  * Documented + hooked up 4bpp/8bpp select on layers.

  * Fixed a bug in the hng64 dma.
- goldstar.c improvements / changes [David Haywood]:
  * Added scroll registers for the girl when enabled in attract mode.
  * Documented how you can swap the blue/green bonus colours (but left the code disabled, I think versions with it swapped probably just have different proms).
  * Added gfxdecode for cmasterc.
- Memory maps merges for the following drivers [Angelo Salese]:
  * groundfx.c
  * lastduel.c
  * macrossp.c
  * madmotor.c (also cleaned-up some video variables in it)
  * mcatadv.c (also reduced a 1.0 clipping out volume setting)
  * moo.c
- Changed the way memory allocation is handled. Rather than allocating in terms of bytes, allocations are now done in terms of objects. This is done via new set of macros that replace the malloc_or_die() macro:
  alloc_or_die(t) - allocate memory for an object of type 't'
  alloc_array_or_die(t,c) - allocate memory for an array of 'c' objects of type 't'
  alloc_clear_or_die(t) - same as alloc_or_die but clears the memory
  alloc_array_clear_or_die(t,c) - alloc_array_or_die with clearing.
- All original callers of malloc_or_die have been updated to call these new macros. If you just need an array of bytes, you can use alloc_array_or_die(UINT8, numbytes) [Aaron Giles].
- Made a similar change to the auto_* allocation macros. In addition, added 'machine' as a required parameter to the auto-allocation macros, as the resource pools will eventually be owned by the machine object. The new macros are:
  auto_alloc(m,t) - allocate memory for an object of type 't'.
  auto_alloc_array(m,t,c) - allocate memory for an array of 'c' objects of type 't'.
  auto_alloc_clear(m,t) - allocate and clear.
  auto_alloc_array_clear(m,t,c) - allocate and clear.
- All original calls or auto_malloc have been updated to use the new macros. In addition, auto_realloc(), auto_strdup() auto_astring_alloc(), and auto_bitmap_alloc() have been updated to take a machine parameter [Aaron Giles].
- Changed validity check allocations to not rely on auto_alloc* anymore because they are not done in the context of a machine [Aaron Giles].
- Removed of SMH_BANKn macros. Just use SMH_BANK(n) instead, which is what the previous macros mapped to anyhow [Aaron Giles].
- Added missing casts and made other tweaks to appease some more strict settings on the compiler [Aaron Giles].
- Merged memory maps in the seta.c, sf.c, nbmj8688.c, megasys1.c drivers [Angelo Salese].
- Merged memory maps in the overdriv.c and demoted it tothe GNW flag [Angelo Salese].

- Moved paletteram_IIBBGGRR_w() from senjyo.c to emu/video/generic.c [Angelo Salese].
- Removed deprecat.h dependancy for usgames.c [Angelo Salese].
- Add READY line readback to the SN76496 core, cleaned up the structs a bit, cleaned up comments, added more TODOs, Fixed some unsaved savestate related stuff. [Lord Nightmare].
- Added sn76496 ready line hook-up for spcforce.c, doesn't make a difference since it's not actually used [Angelo Salese].
- Added RTC emulation for hng64 driver [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed sprite trail for mnight and robokid [kanikani].
- Factored out some more MESS specific code for Atari 8bit [Fabio Priuli].

- Added sound to 'Pocket Gal Deluxe (bootleg)' [Angelo Salese].
- lordgun - Fix: P1 Button2 is really P2 Button1 [Cananas].
- Changed 'Lunar Lander' thrust control to a pedal. This more accurately emulates the control. Note: the current code uses IPT_PADDLE. This causes the game to start with the thrust at 50%. This is not correct. The control is really a hand operated pedal [Derrick Renaud].
- Merged memory maps for nycaptor, nbmj8991, nbmj8891, mystwarr [Angelo Salese].
- First layer of memory map merging for namcos2.c and namcos21.c, needs a second hand in order to remove all the SMH references (they both are macroized to hell) [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed 'Yellow Cab (Japan)' booting, promoted to working status [Angelo Salese].
- Attempted to fix colors in 'Koi Koi Part 2' [Angelo Salese].
- Lowered DAC volume in Karate Champ from 0.50 to 0.15, it was having sound clipping problems since day one [Angelo Salese].
- Cleaned-up HNG64 system ports [Angelo Salese].
- Changed the z80_bank_addr in megadriv.c into a simple 9 bit shift register. Fixes mantis 2817 [Enik Land].
- Improved interrupt handling for the 8/16 bit H8s [R. Belmont].
- System 23: hooked up serial comms between subcpu and I/O board [R. Belmont].
- Added a driver for Irem M14 HW [Angelo Salese].
- Removed deprecat.h dependancy for kopunch.c [Angelo Salese].
- Naomi: hacked up 3D renderer. Still quite preliminary but allows most games to show graphics [Olivier Galibert, David Haywood].
- Converted the WAVE sound device to stereo (for MESS) [Curt Coder].

- Corrected sauro main cpu to 5Mhz and YM3812 to 2.5Mhz as verified on the PCB [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Improved protection emulation in galpani2 driver [Luis Faria]:
  * Modified somewhat the protection handling, geeting rid of the need to call galpani2_mcu_run from VIDEO_UPDATE, as that function is  performed by CPU2's INT7 and it now works. And added support for command 2, making gp2se go into demo mode and allowing to go  ingame, nice skulls! ;-) Unfortunately, this set is still not playable because of missing gals in the background and sometimes there's an ADDRESS ERROR, causing a reset. Included in these changes, I added support for MCU triggering by CPU2.
  * Changed some 8 bit writes disguised as 16 bit to AM_WRITE8 and AM_DEVWRITE8 and some AM_WRITE(SMH_NOP)s to AM_WRITENOP.
  * "crystallized" the clocks of the M68000s and OKIs, deriving the latter from the former.
  * Fixed a Copy&Paste mistake I made in the previous submission, in the sound ROM mappings for galpani2/2t/2g.
  * Reduced the input port definition duplication by using PORT_INCLUDE where applicable instead of defining everything again.
  * Reduced the CPU#2 Code region size to the effectively used size, and expanded the CPU#2 Backgrounds Data region size to the maximum usable size, making it the same for all sets.
- Fixed bug when setting breakpoints on Z80 CPUs at addresses A-F [Xander Xander].
