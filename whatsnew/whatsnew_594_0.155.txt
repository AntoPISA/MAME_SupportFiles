- NS8250 Fixes [smf]:
  * Loopback: tx goes high and data is clocked at the correct rate instead of appearing instantly Modem status register: don't lose track of external signals when starting, resetting, switching loopback off, writing to register Handshaking: active low for consistency (RS232 port now defaults handshaking lines high and serial mouse dtr/rts handling has been adjusted).
- Memory system and Namco improvements [Alex Jackson]:
  * Explicit regions in address maps (AM_REGION) are now looked up relative to the device rather than as siblings when in an internal address map (similar to devices and shared pointers)  Besides being more orthogonal than before, this allows internal ROMs of MCUs and similar devices to be hooked up in a nicer and more foolproof way. Updated the m37710 and m5074x (m6502 derivative) to take advantage of this.
  * Divided the M37702/M37710 into specific models, with each model having its own internal address map containing the correct amounts of internal RAM and ROM.
  * M37702 MCUs found on various Namco PCBs are now all unique devices and have their respective internal ROMs loaded as device ROMs.
- namcops2: Documentation fixes [Guru].
- addrmap.c: Only install the default device address map if the owner didn't provide one [Alex Jackson].
- 8250: Call interrupt callback after clearing internal interrupt state when resetting [smf].

- wd_fdc: Hopefully fix reading sectors with DDAM [lowen, O. Galibert].
- Moved protection vectors from hachamfb to hachamf, making the latter to work properly too [Angelo Salese].
- web: Allow pasting in text [Firehawke].
