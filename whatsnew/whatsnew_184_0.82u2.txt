Source changes:
----------------------
- onetwo: Fixed glitch on Title screen. Colours could do with being checked on this [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- goal92: Fixed clock, visible area and found it's missing the adpcm emulation. I tried to add it, but i had no luck, so if anyone want to have a look, please do it ;-) [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- I386 and Mame Debugger Enhancements [Nathan Woods]:
  * Attempting to start a trace with non-existant registers will now raise a warning in the MAME debugger;
  * Implemented mame_debug_trace_write() call, an API to allow injecting text into the trace files of the MAME debugger;
  * CALL16 opcode will now only adjust IP instead of EIP when in 16-bit mode;
  * Minor bug fix in RETF opcode;
  * Changed REP and REPNE opcode implementations to use the same code;
  * INTO will now interrupt even if IF is zero.
- Misc Improvements [Curt Coder]:
  * Memory map merge;
  * Moved paddle2 trickery to machine.
- Nintendo 8080 hardware update: The driver has now been split into three parts. A few features that have been missing in Helifire since my last update are back, i.e. the flickering colors when you're shot and the volume decay effect (this affects the melody at the start of a game and a few tunes that can be heard during the bonus scenes every twelve attack waves). The starfield should now scroll at the correct speed, it's only 75% of what it used to be. Finally, I have decided to use the color prom from Space Fever in Space Launcher, I think it's correct [Stefan Jokisch].
- Change to eeprom_interface_93C46: please check games using this to make sure non broke [Tomasz Slanina].
- Debugger: With this patch you can output traces to the console ( or grep etc ) by typing: TRACE CONSOLE [smf].
- ST-V updates [Mariusz Wojcieszek]:
  * Fixed bugs introduced in previous update: RGB sprites bad colors and incorrect sprite clipping;
  * Added color offset for RGB sprites;
  * Fixed horizontal scrolling for bitmaps (corrects mausuke ingame background).
- Change to EEPROM_interface eeprom_interface_93C46 [Tomasz Slanina].
- Seattle update [Aaron Giles]:
  * x86drc.c: Fleshed out SSE support. Made it optional for recompilers to keep the PC/ICount in registers. Made append_verify_code work for sizes > 4;
  * CPU/mips/mips3.c: Added support for the Config register. Added support for new variants: R4700, QED5271, RM7000. Fixed bug in LWXC1/LDXC1/SWXC1/SDXC1 instructions;
  * Added support for the Config register;
