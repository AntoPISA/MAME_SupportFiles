0.36b12 1999/12/18 [#086 - Nicola Salmoria]
-------------------------------------------
To all people that submitted high score save updates: high score save is on hold. No additions will be made for the time being. In the near future, high score support will be removed from the executable to an external file, much like the cheat.dat one. We are looking for a volunteer to maintain that file.


New games supported
-------------------
(hal21)    HAL21 [Phil Stroffolino]
(madmotor) Mad Motor [Nicola Salmoria]
(pinbo)    Pinbo (Strike) [Scott Kelley]

New clones supported
--------------------
(archriv2) Arch Rivals (rev 2.0) [Aaron Giles]
(burningh) Burning Fight (set 2) [Nicola Salmoria]
(dspirito) Dragon Spirit (old version) [Ernesto Corvi]
(finalizb) Finalizer - Super Transformation (bootleg) [Nicola Salmoria]
(hal21j)   HAL21 (Japan) [Phil Stroffolino]
(madgearj) Mad Gear (Japan) [Nicola Salmoria]
(paintrlr) Paint Roller [Nicola Salmoria]
(raidena)  Raiden (Alternate Hardware) [Nicola Salmoria]
(raidenk)  Raiden (Korea) [Nicola Salmoria]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------
- 8039 in Finalizer [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed hanging music in Raiden [Bryan McPhail].
- Fixed missing sounds in roishtar [CAB].


Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- Bypassed the protection in Exerion [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed hangs in roishtar [E. Watanabe, Takahiro Nogi].
- The hangs in Tempest caused by the Pokey protection should now be fixed once and for all [Juergen Buchmueller].


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------
- [DOS] Artwork files can be stored in a .zip file. That way you can have eg. both spacewr1.png and spacewr2.png in one file spacewar.zip [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Added cpu overclocking control to the on screen display [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Added the possibility to use a multiple keys or joysticks sequence to drive a generic action. This can be handy with consoles or cabinets with a limited number of buttons, to reuse all buttons with only one extra button, like a shift key. For example the COIN1 action can be mapped to the "Player 1 Fire" plus the "Extra Shift Button". It can also be used to map Q*Bert movements to joystick diagonals (since the orginal used a joystick rotate 45 degrees) [Andrea Mazzoleni].


Source changes:
---------------
- PORTERS BEWARE: the OS dependant code is now required to support a palettized 16-bit display, where osd_modify_pen() can be called and the palette lookup is done during the final blit. A non palettized display can still optionally be used in special cases, see the comment about osd_allocate_colors() in osdepend.h. Also note that osd_allocate_colors() now can fail and returns a value; and the special case for 32768 pens has been removed, a valid palette is always passed to the function [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed OPN and OPM output level. Unfortunately this means that all games using YM2203, YM2151 etc. need to be rebalanced [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Removed memory_region from struct MachineCPU, now this information is stored directly in the ROM list using the REGION_CPUx attributes. Also remember that now you must never use Machine->memory_region[], always use memory_region() (and the same for memory_region_length) [Nicola Salmoria].
