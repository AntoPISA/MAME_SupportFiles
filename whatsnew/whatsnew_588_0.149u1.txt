 [Samuele Zannoli]
 * Adds lots of mmx and sse opcodes to the i386 processor.
 * Adds the fcomip x87 opcode.
 * Adds a "UINT8 *memory(UINT32 &size)" method to the naomi_gdrom_board device that returns the size and a pointer to the decrypted gdrom data (used by chihiro). Then for the chihiro driver:
  * Adds basic stuff for the Nvidia audio APU.
  * Adds the "chihiro curthread" debugger command, shows information about the current active thread.
  * Adds the "chihiro irq,<number>" debugger command, to generate an interrupt with irq number 0-15 by hand.
  * Adds more patches to let the software run even if usb is not implemented.
  * Adds the Chihiro Type 1 baseboard/mediaboard features to let the system load the gdrom games.
  * Adds incomplete save state support.
  * Adds support to the Nvidia 3d accelerator to draw primitives where the vertex data is not stored in a vertex buffer but contained in the command stream.
- IDE: Uses one timer instead of anonymous timers, so that resetting the device will stop any outstanding work. BSY is always set when waiting for the busy timer to fire. Implemented DASP & PDIAG functionality, device 1 is detected during reset & if device 1 fails diagnostic then device 0 sets bit 7 of it's diagnostic result. Ide cards now default to 1 hard disk, otherwise device 1 without a chd will cause device 0 to report a controller error (AMIBIOS for example doesn't allow booting from device 0 if device 1 fails). Timing of DASP & PDIAG is set very short because of lack of wait states when accessing ATA bus. Improved SRST functionality, which has meant viper needed to be changed to trigger a hard reset instead of a soft reset. Writes to the command register are now ignored with BSY or DRQ is set (packet devices can accept the DEVICE RESET command but they are not supported yet) [smf].
- harddriv.c: Converted to use modern n68681 device [Osso].

  * Fixed R=M disassembly.
  * Added flag formatting.
  * Shadow register is hooked up.
  * Opcode & flag fixes.
- toaplan2.c: bgaregga DSW3 really are dipswitches and not "configuration". Also, make bbakraid inputs inherit from very similar batrider [Alex Jackson].
- Don't crash if pcap can't find a network interface's name [Richard L. Hamilton].
- RSP SSE optimizations/changes [MooglyGuy]:
  * Fixed load/store opcodes.
  * Added SSE versions of the following opcodes: VMADH, VADD, VSUB, VADDC, VSUBC, VCH, VCR, VMRG, VAND, VNAND, VOR, VNOR, VXOR, and VNXOR.
- Modernization of the remainder of taitoic as well as the deco_bac06 device [Osso].

- Modernized the following konicdev.c devices (k056832, k054000, k053936, k051316, k051733).  [Osso].
- Toaplan driver improvements [Alex Jackson, Guru]:
  * Reorganized hellfire clone sets and improved descriptions: hellfire3 -> hellfire1  "Hellfire (1P set)" hellfire2 -> hellfire2a "Hellfire (2P set, older)" hellfire1 -> hellfire1a "Hellfire (1P set, older)"
  * Reorganized outzone sets and improved descriptions: outzonec -> outzone  "Out Zone" (new parent) outzone -> outzoneh "Out Zone (harder)" (former parent) outzonea -> outzonea "Out Zone (old set)" outzoned -> outzoneb "Out Zone (older set)" outzoneb -> outzonec "Out Zone (oldest set)".

  * Made some more additions and fixed some errors in Stephh's notes.
  * Replaced truxton Z80 ROM with correctly sized one.
  * Replaced hellfire2a Z80 ROM with correct one from parent set.

  * Corrected Z80 address map (RAM size is only 2KB).
  * Corrected manufacturer name for zerowing2.
  * Corrected ROM names in twincobr and clones.

- Modernized the Beezer sound device [Osso].
- Modernized the namco sound device [Osso].
- Modernized the TX1, HC55516 and Exidy 440 CVSD audio devices [Osso].
- Split up the video devices contained in taitoic.c  [Osso].
- QS1000 sound core issue now not a mandatory include which allows tiny builds to be built without it [MAMESICK].
- Fixed some unknown DIPs and corrected others from manual examinations for lethalj.c [Bad A Billy].
- Memory system: added endianness to the memory_share class [Aaron Giles].
- Tilemap system: numerous changes:  [Aaron Giles]:
  * Moved remaining legacy macros and typedefs to tilelgcy.h. This revealed a few drivers mixing and matching modern & legcy, which have now been fixed.
  * Changed get info callback signature to no longer pass the user_data pointer, but instead pass a reference to the tilemap object itself. Updated those few drivers using user_data to pull it out of the tilemap object with the new user_data() getter method.
  * Changed get info and mapping callbacks to be device_delegates so that they can be described at config time.
  * Added tilemap_memory object that is used internally for reading/writing to memory that backs a tilemap. This object is used to track a memory pointer that backs tilemap memory, and also is designed to transparently handle all bus width and endianness associated with reading and writing data in a tilemap.
  * Incorporated two tilemap_memory objects (basemem and extmem) into the tilemap object and added accessors to them, as well as read/write handlers for reading/writing to entries stored in the memory. This means that tilemap get info callbacks can now easily read data out of the tilemap in a generic way.
  * Rejiggered the initialization sequence for tilemap objects so that the tilemap_manager is not required to be present at instantiation.
  * Created a new tilemap_device, which can be used to declare a tilemap in the machine config, and which also is a tilemap object itself. The tilemap device will look for shared memory regions called "<tag>" and "<tag>_ext" and automatically plug them into the tilemap. The device also provides write handlers that can be used to write to the tilemap memory and mark tiles dirty, saving the need for each driver to write their own.
- Device system: moved required/optional device finders to a new header devfind.h [Aaron Giles].
- Atari drivers: removed all playfield and alpha memory and tilemap variables, apart from those needed by atarivc-using games (this will become a device in a future update). Updated all Atari 16-bit drivers to use the new tilemap_device instead, which provides all the needed functionality in a more generic way [Aaron Giles].
- volfied.c: Added dipswitch locations to the 'Volfied' sets [Brian Troha].
- thepit.c: Added dipswitch locations to 'The Pit', 'Round-Up', 'Fitter', 'Intrepid', 'Dock Man' and 'Port Man' sets. Gave 'Desert Dan" it's own dipswitches and corrected them based on results of game play [Brian Troha].
- suna8.c: Added dipswitch locations to 'Rough Ranger', 'Super Ranger', 'Hard Head', 'Spark Man', 'Star Fighter', 'Hard Head 2' and 'Brick Zone' sets. Correct default settings as per manuals [Brian Troha].
- stfight.c: Added dipswitch locations to the 'Empire City: 1931' and 'Street Fighter' sets [Brian Troha].
- shanghai.c: Added dipswitch locations to 'Shanghai' and 'Shanghai 2' [Brian Troha].
- itech32.c: Some minor corrections of dipswitches. Added a note about the Japanese World Class Bowling trackball input is read at an 45 degree offset compared to normal orientation [Brian Troha].
- Data East Protection Work [Charles MacDonald, David Haywood]:
 * Complete new Data East 146 emulation based on extensive hardware tests. The following now use a single implementation rather than incomplete per-game implementations:
  Edward Randy (60)
  Mutant Fighter (66)
  Captain America (75)
  Lemmings (75)
  Robocop 2 (75)
  Super Shanghai Dragon's Eye (146)
  Funky Jet (146)
  Sotsugyo Shousho (146)
  Nitro Ball (146)
  Fighter's History (146)
  Stadium Hero 96 (146)
  Dragon Gun (146)
  Lock 'n' Loaded (146)
  * This fixes glitches in Fighter's History and Edward Randy in addition to bringing Super Shanghai to a working state.
  * Similar work has been started for the 104 based games, but no complete table has been derived from real hardware yet.
- Split the KonamiIC file into individual device files and moved all implementations of each device into those files, started to unify some code between the GX/Non-GX cases in addition to heavy cleanup of variable usage / names [David Haywood].
- tms1xxx.c, hcd62121.c, i4004.c, alph8201.c, apexc.c, am29000.c, arm.c, arm7.c, ccpu.c, cop400.c, cp1610.c: Modernized cpu cores [Wilbert Pol].
- Fixed Yamaha OPL key scale level orders [Alexey, Phil Bennett].
- Further observations about how the DVI video roms map on Dragon Gun and playback flags, fixed it not to hang at the last boss due to these for now [David Haywood].
- psikyo.c: Add dipswitch locations to all sets in the driver. Filled in some unknown dipswitches for Battle K-Road. Moved Region settings into the Game Configuration menu. Added a note about the Free Play mode in the Strikers 1945 sets not working [Brian Troha].
