Source changes:
---------------
- Warning Cleanups [Nathan Woods, David Haywood].
- ST-V update [Angelo Salese]:
  * Added a kludge for Astra Super Stars to let it run past a nasty code, nasty because I highly suspect it's a sh-2 bug,will be worked out in the future;
  * Added some new vdp2 registers,for example the DISP one for avoid transitions draws;
  * Re-added the layer disable/enable code that I sent in the past which was lost,and removed the possibility to disable layers with non-debug builds;
  * Started to add default eeproms for the various games,for now I've hooked  up the one in Shienryu to let it run already with Vertical Switch;
  * Added the dynamic clocks,hopefully now 100% working.
- TNZS driver update [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * Fixed crash due to code execution across bank cboundary;
  * Removed kludges which were required to run Arkanoid 2 (they were just mirror addresses);
  * Added sprite banking (same as seta.c). Insecotr X and other were obvoisly running at 30fps before, now they are ok;
  * Added sprite buffering (not quite the same as seta.c). Fixes kabukiz sprites and backgrounds, though there might still be a few glitches;
  * Fixed kabukiz sound.
- Correct NeoGeo Mirroring + additional information on coin counters etc. [Razoola].
- Lethal Enforcers updates [Nicola Salmoria, R. Belmont].
- uPD7759 rewrite, fixing sound in System 16 games [Aaron Giles].
