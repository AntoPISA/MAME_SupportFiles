-timetrv: Hooked up 1-bit audio DAC [Ryan Holtz] (#9476) [MooglyGuy]
 * Co-authored-by: MooglyGuy <mog@home>

-Debugger feature improvements [AJR]
 * Add 'gbt' and 'gbf' debugger commands to step until a true or false conditional branch has been detected.
 * Update over 100 of the disassemblers in MAME to output a new STEP_COND flag for all conditional branches. Besides being used for
    execution of the new 'gbt' and 'gbf' commands, this flag also now helps the debugger 'out' command to properly handle
    conditional return instructions.
 * Remove STEP_OVER from many instructions that aren't actually subroutine calls (e.g. DJNZ on Z80). A 'gni' debugger command (go
    next instruction) has been added to accommodate some of the misuse.
 * Add instruction flag support to several more disassemblers that lacked them entirely (e.g. st62xx)
 * Don't pass over delay slots for debugging in ASAP core

-formats: fixed GCC compile [Ivan Vangelista]

-cpu: remove obsolete debugger.h include from some of my files [hap]

-util/corealloc.h: Reduced make_unique_clear to a single variant for POD arrays [Vas Crabb].
 * Enabled GCC lifetime dead store elimination optimisation.
 * emu/device.h: Don't pre-clear memory for drivers.  Ivan Vangelista fixed at least the majority of things that crashed outright,
    and Robbbert initialised variables that coverity complained about.  It's unlikely anything will break due to this.
 * sound/discrete.h: Explicitly initialise members of discrete "devices" to zero.  I don't see a way around doing this in headers
    due to the macro soup used to build the constructors.
 * sound/mos6581.cpp: Moved creation of the SID core to device_start and explictly initialised members of the SID core structures.
    These structures are in internal headers, so they won't cause downstream recompiles.

-Lua engine: Made I/O port manager type_seq a bit more tolerant of omitted arguments [Vas Crabb].

-Revert initialisation of device members in headers [Vas Crabb].
 * This is problematic in several ways:
   - Initialising things at construction that aren't needed until after start slows down -romident, -validate, -listxml, etc.  Slot
      cards can be a particular drain on -listxml and -validate as they're instantiated for every compatible slot.  It's more
      pronounced for array members, too.
   - Splitting member initialisation between declaration in headers and constructors in source files means you have to look at two
      places to check for the initial value, and you always need to check the constructor even if an initialiser is present in the
      header because the constructor initaliser list takes precedence.  (This isn't as much of an issue for driver classes because
      the constructor is most often inlined at declaration, so it isn't far from the member declarations.)
   - Initialisers in headers for frequently-used devices increases the frequency of recompiling dependent devices/drivers as they're
      exposed to any changes in initialisers.
   - Initialisers in frequently-used headers increase build times because there's more for the compiler to parse/cache.  (This
      affects makedep.py as well for single-driver builds, but that's a single pass.)  It's not a lot individually, but it adds up
      given the size of MAME, which keeps increasing.  We've already had one contributor banned from GitHub actions for resource
      usage, we don't want to waste compiler time unnecessarily.

-Try to work around the uninitialised member warning in sol::optional [Vas Crabb].

 * This will hopefully work around the very unhelpful uninitialised variable warning that seems to be triggered by using Sol's get
    function with std::optional<T> or sol::optional<T> on Linux.

-Changed floppy_image_device::init_fs() to set the dirty bit on the floppy image (#9507) [npwoods]
 * This is not an actual user facing bug right now, because in the MAME UI the call to init_fs() is followed up by a call to
    setup_write(), which forces the image to commit without regard to the dirty bit.  There is an argument that this is itself code
    smell; setup_write() perhaps should be set_output_format() and not arbitrarily perform a commit.

Clones promoted to working
--------------------------
Super Poker (V100xD03) / Formosa [Luca Elia, ANY]

-osd: Added multibyte check to osd_uchar_from_osdchar to fix decoding ASCII text (#9536) [987123879113]
 * This allows ASCII INI files to be parsed on Windows systems set to use a double-byte code page.  It should also work with
    correctly-encoded Shift-JIS, GB2312, Big5 and EUC-KR.  It won t work for more complex variable-length encodings, or when the
    input is not correctly encoded.

-Revert "igs017.cpp: Improved protection and decryption [Luca Elia]" [Vas Crabb]
 * This reverts commit ec3cd170e74a1d1eacc52536e4568f0797e4648a.
 * This is problematic in several ways:
   - Substantial protection data in source.
   - Non-portable code doesn't build with clang.
   - General quality issues.

-Consolidated floppy_image_device::m_create_fs and floppy_image_device::m_io_fs vectors (#9542) [npwoods]
 * Consolidated floppy_image_device::m_create_fs and floppy_image_device::m_io_fs vectors
   - We had two separate members in floppy_image_device (m_create_fs and m_io_fs) that contained the same data.  Whether the file
      systems can be formatted or read can be identified by querying fs::manager_t.
   - For this reason, it seems bad to have these separate members, the seemingly only reason to make the UI code slightly less
      complicated.  For this reason I consolidated these two members and moved the burden of selecting which ones are creatable to
      the UI code.

Blood Storm (v2.21) [coolmod]

-angelkds.cpp, crgolf.cpp: finders and other small cleanups [Ivan Vangelista]

-Fixed some issues involving fs::meta_description construction (#9546) [npwoods]
 * Fixed some issues involving fs::meta_description constructing
   - With the recent change to use std::variant more closely, I noticed a problem where meta_descriptions of type meta_type::String
      got defaults of type 't'.  This was because the templated ctor for meta_description would convert 'const char *' to 'bool'.
      This change adds another overload to catch 'const char *', along with asserts to catch problems.
   - In the process I corrected a few meta_description ctors
   - It is possible that this change does not go far enough.  Perhaps the meta_type argument should be removed, and we should
      instead create distinct ctor types (rather than relying on templates) and specify the precise meta_type in the overload.  Or
      even go further and remove m_type from meta_description, and instead create an overload that calculates meta_type based on
      calling std::visit on the variant
 * Taking this change a bit further, and removing m_type from fs::meta_description; it was superfluous.  Also doing some minor
    C++-ifications

-File handling cleanup [AJR]
 * Remove fgetc, fgets and ptr methods from device_image_interface.
 * Remove the core_file::buffer method to read an entire file into memory and rewrite emu_file::hashes to not depend on it.
 * Make core_in_memory_file a final class; now that buffering is gone, core_osd_file no longer subclasses it but a new superclass
    that retains some common methods.
 * Rename the offset and length methods used internally in core_file implementations to index and size due to frequent clashes with
    parameter names.
 * Convert comments in util/corefile.cpp to C++ style.
 * Add a new overload of the hash_collection::compute method which hashes data from a random_read stream, reading it into memory one
    chunk at a time. As a result, the hash_collection::begin and hash_collection::end methods have been removed as obsolete (similar
    methods are now used internally only).
 * Enhance error messages for the frontend media identifier when it encounters file errors.

-osborne1.cpp: revert floppy device back to SSDD (#9625) [theoldsport]
 * Partially reverts an old commit from @Robbbert (https://github.com/mamedev/mame/commit/247939853301565efd348cad12b04fc957707bc2)
    where the floppy device was (mistakenly ) set to FLOPPY_525_QD (quad density) from FLOPPY_525_SSDD (single-sided
    double-density).
 * As far as I am aware, the Osborne1 only supported SSSD and SSDD disks. Revert appears to resolve known Osborne1 issues
