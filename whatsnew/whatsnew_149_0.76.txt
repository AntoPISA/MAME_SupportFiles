0.76 2003/10/19 [#149 - David Haywood]
--------------------------------------
It appears no new timer system related bugs were found with 0.75u1 so *hopefully* this release will be better than the last, 0.75 ended up not being not too great due to the problems with the YM2151 sound etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Bishi Bashi Championship Mini Game Senshuken [R. Belmont] (some gfx problems)
VS. Freedom Force [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Source changes:
---------------
- Added Insector sound ROM loading [Fabrice Frances].
- Changed Jumping Cross default dipswitches.
- Fixed invalid dipswitch in Big Event Golf.
- Readded a bit of code that was removed from blockage driver when it was converted to use tilemap (blasto needed it).
- Various ST-V and SH-2 improvements, shienryu is improved as are many other games but no more are really playable yet (although I have changed Shienryu to IMPERFECT_GFX instead of NOT_WORKING as it seems ok, just the sprites are black) [David Haywood, Olivier Galibert, sthief, Angelo Salese].
