Source changes:
---------------
- 4bpp/8bpp tilemaps in ST-0016 driver [Tomasz Slanina].
- Added generic support for save states on games using the generic bitmap video hardware. Also converted a number of drivers over to using that system [Andrew Gardner].
- Added new function: compute_resistor_net_outputs() in res_net.h. This  function calculates outputs (not weights) of color circuits where the hardware consists of open collector PROMs [Jarek Burczynski].
- Fixed an issue in the H8/3002 core where the timer start register would mess up timers that were already running.  Improves the music tempo for S12 games.
- Fixed DIP switches in the Midway Zeus games [Brian Troha].
- Fixed disassembly in mirrored regions for the 6502 [Curt Coder].
- Fixed incorrect graphics decode in the Donkey Kong driver [Andrea Mazzoleni].
- Fixed input ports in the megasys1 driver [Mamesick].
- Fixed mame_fprintf to output various text file formats based on the compile-time define CRLF. This must be set and can be equal to 1 (CR only), 2 (LF only) or 3 (CR+LF) [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed memory crash in the TMS34010 core [Andrea Mazzoleni].
- Fixed naming of the various Centipede bootlegs [Stefan Jokisch].
- Fixed several bugs in the new input system and improved the CFG file format [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed several compilation issues for LinuxPPC and other ports [Lawrence Gold].
- Fixed subtle behavior in the ALLPOT handlers for the POKEY when held in reset [MikeJ].
- Fixed the mixer code so it doesn't crash if the OSD layer returns an error [Andrea Mazzoleni].
- Hooked up NVRAM for Namco system 12 correctly [smf].
- Improved colors in Strike Bowling [Jarek Burczynski].
- Improved i386 disassembly format [Ville Linde].
- Improved QSound in ZN games by fixing ROM loading [Barry Rodewald].
- Included all the worthwhile sound changes from MAME32FX (most of these in turn are from MAME32Plus). List and (credits) follows:
  * airbustr.c: FM/PCM balance (RND)
  * crimfght.c: adjusted YM and Z80 clock to 4 MHz, matches real PCB better (???)
  * darkseal.c: FM/PCM balance (UNZU)
  * ddragon.c: FM/PCM balance (???)
  * mitchell.c: adjusted pitches (AKIN)
  * namcos1.c: FM/PCM balance (UNZU)
  * namcos2.c: FM/PCM balance (RND)
  * nemesis.c: PSG/WSG balance (UNZU)
  * rohga.c: FM/PCM balance (RND)
  * shadfrce.c: FM/PCM balance (RND)
  * simpsons.c: Z80+YM2151 clocks, FM/PCM balance (???)
  * toki.c: FM/PCM balance (???)
  * vaportra.c: FM/PCM balance (UNZU)
  * xmen.c: FM/PCM balance, Z80 clock is 8 MHz (???)
- Preliminary NEC V810 core (needed for mayjinsen, mayjinsen2 and jsk) [Thomasz Slanina].
- Removed PORT_CENTER from drivers that were using it for autocentering and added a user-configurable autocentering property that applies to all absolute analog controls. Also made this autocentering intelligent so that it shouldn't need to be manually set to 0 if using a real analog device [Aaron Giles].
- Significant improvements to the Rabbit driver [David Haywood].
