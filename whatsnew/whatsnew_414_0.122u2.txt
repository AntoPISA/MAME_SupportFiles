---------------------------------------


MAME Testers Bugs Fixed (5):
---------------------------
- hunchbkd0122red (Couriersud)
- mwalk0122red (Couriersud)
- pestplce0122red (Couriersud)
- qtheater0122u1ora (Philip Bennett)
- radarscp0122yel (Couriersud)


Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed M65C02 optimization [Peter Trauner].
- TMS51xx and M58817 speech updates [Couriersud]:
  * radarsc1 uses tms5110 speech synth;
  * CVS games: According to PCBInfos speech chip is TMS5100. Changed driver to use TMS5100 and "game system operational" now sounds more natural;
  * Removed sound/m58817.*;
  * Added support for multiple coefficients maps to tms5110.*;
  * Added coefficient maps for TMS5100 and M58817 from documented sources to tms5110r.c;
  * Fixed interpolation factors (see tms5110r.c for reason);
  * Made lattice calculation precision 9bit;
  * Added support for READBIT and LOADADDRESS commands to tms5110.c;
  * More changes in line with various patents;
  * Documented TRS-02, TKG-02/03 "voice" interface.
- Completed the addition of static qualifiers to all MAME symbols that aren't explicitly exported [Atari Ace].
- Named the input_seq_type enumeration and used it explicitly in several places [Nathan Woods].
- Corrected tx1 and tx1a coinage DSW assignments. Reversed buggyboy/buggybjr 'Game Time' settings [Philip Bennett].
- TMS3203x core updates [Aaron Giles]:
  * Fixed interrupt handling;
  * Added support for edge-triggered interrupts on '32;
  * Expanded interrupt support for the '32;
  * Updated drivers using TMS3203x core to deassert interrupts;
  * Added externally accessible functions for converting '3x floating point format;
  * Updated gaelco3d driver to use new functions.
- Zeus2 (+related) updates [Aaron Giles]:
  * Fixed save states for DCS games;
  * Cleaned up Zeus2 waveram handling;
  * Added Zeus2 save state support;
  * Added preliminary model and quad rendering support for Zeus2;
  * Added support to timekpr for the ZPRAM used on Zeus2;
  * Hooked up ZPRAM in Zeus2 games;
  * Hooked up controls in Zeus2 games;
  * Updated poly.c to ensure it is idle before saving state;
  * Added artifical Z offset of -2 to make the full screen show in crusnexo.
- Replaced tekken2/tekken2a/tekken2b 'tes1wave.8k' ROM with the correct, non-byte-swapped dump [Philip Bennett].
- Added discrete 74LS624(56789) implementation [Couriersud]:
  * DISCRETE_74LS624 is a VCO needed for (dkongjr);
  * Supports Logic, Energy and Count outputs.
- dkong updates [Couriersud]:
  * Added dkongjr discrete sound;
  * Proper interface Z80 - I8035 for (dkongjr);
  * Changed discrete sound output factors;
  * Removed samples support for (dkongjr);
  * Cosmetic changes;
  * Fixed regression in (radarscp) sound;
  * Added DIP switch locations to (dkong3b).
- Documentation and clock frequency improvements for seta.c [Brian Troha]:
  * Added the Guru's readme info for Thundercade;
  * Corrected ROM name for Thundercade;
  * Changed clocks to OSC by divider IE: 16000000/2 /* 8MHz */;
  * Changed Orbs clock to 16MHz with note about 14.xx MHz;
  * Changed Meta Fox's x0-006 (65c02) to same as Thundercade;
  * Changed the YM3438 in Ultra Toukond Densetsu from 6MHz to 1600000/4 /* 4MHz */ as there is no mention of 6MHz OSC on PCB.
- Verified a number of clock frequencies from real PCBs [Corrado Tomaselli, Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed several memory leaks related to SCSI CD emulation [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Removed the increasing of the R register from each IX/IY related (FD xx or DD xx) instruction on the Z80. According to documentation and the behavior of the Amstrad CPC driver, this is incorrect [Barry Rodewald].
- Added initial FPU support to the SH4 core [Samuele Zannoli].
- Adjusted most conditional logging in MAME to use the idiom "do { if (VERBOSE) logerror x; } while (0)". This has the benefit that the compiler checks the syntax of the logging even in the case it will be eliminated, and in fact a number of cases here needed adjustments to compile because of this [Atari Ace].
