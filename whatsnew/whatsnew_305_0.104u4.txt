0.104u4 2006/03/02 [#305 - Aaron Giles]
---------------------------------------
IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: 
1. osd_pause is no longer called directly. Rather, your osd_init function should register the osd_pause callback (if necessary) using add_pause_callback.
2. osd_die is now handled by the core; you should remove this function from the OSD layer.
3. logerror is front-ended in the core; it calls to a new OSD function osd_logerror which handles the OS-specific file and/or debugger logging.

Source changes:
---------------
- Added comments support to the debugger. You can now dynamically add comments that are visible next to the disassembly view. Comments are saved to an XML-based .cmt file in a 'comments' directory by default upon exiting [Andrew Gardner].
- Added "wb+" disposition to osd_tool_fopen [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed cheat timer to fire at the correct rate. Also fixed initialization order to work around dependency on the video/UI system [Ian Patterson].
- Added save states to 3 more drivers: arkanoid.c, system1.c, and taitosj.c, and to the SN76496 sound chip for system1 [Adam Bousley].
- Fixed a couple of small memory leaks and a crash bug found by valgrind [Lawrence Gold].
- Added save state support to the tetrisp2 driver [Nathan Woods].
- Added save state support to 'Cloak and Dagger', 'Mario Bros.', 'Crazy Baloon', and the SN76477 sound chip [Adam Bousley].
- Hooked up the R4650 properly in the MIPS recompiler [R. Belmont].
- More Namco System 23 progress: [R. Belmont]
  * Further hardware work.
  * Hooked up H8/3002 MCU and sound system.
  * Many notes added.
  * 'Final Furlong 2' (World and Japan sets) added.
- Added sanity checking to the set_visible_area() call to ensure it is not set larger than the screen bitmap [Nathan Woods].
- Added decryption of the BIOS for the Namco System 10 games using MEMN ROM boards [smf].
- Changed the ROM banking of the Bellfruit 'Adder' card to the new standard, as well as tidying up the MPU4 emulation with some new information [El Condor].
- A bit more progress on 'Raiden 2' sprite decryption [Olivier Galibert].
- Added save states to Namco Classics Collection 1 & 2, Taito B System, and fixed save states in 'Operation Wolf' [Adam Bousley].
- Debugger changes/updates [Aaron Giles]:
  * Added new streaming text buffer system.
  * Rewrote the console window to use the streaming text buffer.
  * Added new log window (Ctrl+L) which displays live error.log output.
  * Added disassembly view menu to control comments versus raw or encrypted opcodes.
  * Added disassembly menu to the main console window as well.
  * Now detect expressions with assignment or ++/-- operators as commands, do you can just say "pc=0" to modify registers instead of needing to type "do pc=0".
  * Fixed bug that would sometimes lock the disassembly view to the top line.
- More global system cleanup [Aaron Giles, Atari Ace]:
  * Remapped osd_die to fatalerror, which cleans up behind itself and returns to the osd code by returning from run_game.
  * Removed a number of unnecessary includes from driver.h.
  * Moved logerror into the core.
  * Moved 68000-specific build rules to cpu.mak
  * New function skip_this_frame, should be called by drivers instead of osd_skip_this_frame.
  * Removed includes of osdepend.h and osd_cpu.h from drivers; only the core should include these.
- More initialization/reset/pause cleanup [Aaron Giles]:
  * New function add_pause_callback can be called by other modules to register a callback for whenever MAME is paused/resumed.
  * Converted all existing pause hooks to use the new system.
  * New function add_reset_callback can be called by other modules to register a callback for whenever MAME is reset.
  * Converted all existing reset hooks to use the new system.
  * Removed machine_reset; replaced with mame_schedule_soft_reset.
  * New function mame_schedule_exit to force an exit cleanly from external events.
  * Removed all the "trying_to_quit" crap from the Windows code.
  * Moved save/restore system out of cpuexec.c into mame.c.
  * Moved core game loop out of cpuexec.c into mame.c.
  * Added hard reset support (complete tear down and re-init).
- More core file shuffling [Aaron Giles]:
  * Split sndintrf.c into sound.c, sndintrf.c, and sndhrdw/generic.c.
  * Added #include vidhrdw/generic.h to mamecore.h, and removed all explicit includes elsewhere.
- Added save state support to the BSMT2000 sound emulator and the dcheese driver [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed missing save state data in the dkong driver [Aaron Giles].
- Updated the 68000 disassembler to use the new interfaces [Aaron Giles].
