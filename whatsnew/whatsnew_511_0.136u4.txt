Fixed TI PSG (sn76489 and friends) noise and square-wave period to be
maximum length when period register is set to 0. Fixed white-noise
phase/XOR issue: got rid of noise XOR/XNOR select, as all chips seem
to use XOR. [Lord Nightmare, Michael Zapf, PlgDavid]

useless code, and fixed a comment [Lord Nightmare].

ui.c,ui.h,windows/input.c: [Miodrag Milanovic]
