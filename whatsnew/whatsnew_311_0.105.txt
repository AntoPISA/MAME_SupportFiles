-------------------------------------
NOTICE: The official Windows binaries are no longer compressed with UPX. This means that when you extract the files, the main MAME.EXE file will be much larger than you are used to. This is normal. The code has always been that big. Leaving it uncompressed will allow MAME to use less memory when run (ironically). 
IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: There have been several changes this cycle that impact you. Please scan this file in detail for the details.
