- 'SS Mission' and "Air Attack' DIP switch fixes [Brian Troha].
- Sync Refresh / Waitvsync / Triplebuffer changes [Alan Kamrowski II]:
  * Changed the waitvsync code to wait for the beginning of the vertical blank (the previous code simply checked if it was in the vblank and only waited if it wasn't).
  * Removed the waitvsync only if game speed is above 95% restriction. This restriction would only cause waitvsync to vacillate between on and off depending on game speed.
  * When syncrefresh and triplebuffer are used, MAME would run the waitvsync code anyway. The triplebuffer code takes care of this already.
- Updated Namco NA-1 to use the real BIOS [R. Belmont, Charles MacDonald].
- Various improvements in 'Airbuster' driver [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
