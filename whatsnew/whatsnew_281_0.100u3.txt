Source changes:
---------------
- More Sega C2/Genesis-based games cleanup [Aaron Giles]:
  * Fixed crashes introduced in last version;
  * Centralized interrupt generation for all Genesis-based games;
  * Implemented protection correctly for Puyo Puyo 2.
- Changed validity checks to use hashes for speed. Also changed them to only run on the drivers in the source file of the current game, rather than on all games, in non-debug builds. And fixed the coinage sorting check so that it doesn't depend on the linker to order the strings in a particular way [Paul Priest].
- Removed -skip_validitychecks option now that the time to execute the checks is not as bad [Aaron Giles].
- Improved speed in 'Top Gunner' by pre-decoding the vector processor microcode. Also added a shift register to produce the LCD-like look of the score and other numbers [Mathis Rosenhauer].
- Nintendo Super System sound update [R. Belmont]:
  * Fixed bugs in SPC700 ADC, SBC, ADDW, SUBW, MUL, DIV, & CLRV opcodes;
  * Fixed several APU hardware/timer issues;
  * Added accurate sound DSP emulation from the latest OpenSPC;
  * Fixed some timing issues that prevented ActRaiser from syncing up. Result: generally accurate sound in the working NSS games, and in many SNES games over in MESS as well.
- Added missing vertical movement to Gatsbee [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
