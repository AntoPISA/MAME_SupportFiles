Source changes:
---------------
- H8/Last Fight update [R. Belmont]:
  * (H8) Limited vector reads to 24 bits;
  * (H8) Added SHLL.W, EXTU.L, SUBS.L #2, and SUBS.L #4 opcodes;
  * Includes Guru's readme;
  * Loads all ROMs;
  * Maps RAM for the stack.
- Converted wcvol95 and hvysmash to use the 16-bit deco tilemap functions [David Haywood].
- Added BCD multiply to ARM coprocessor to fix wcvol95 [David Haywood].
- Cleaned up the Neo Geo mess from 0.103u2 [David Haywood, Razoola].
- Added support for >4GB CHD files to chdman for non-Windows systems [Lawrence Gold].
- Fixed leapyear calculation [William Krick].
- Converted Super Burger Time, Vapor Trail and Crude Buster to use the deco tilemap functions [David Haywood].
- Rewrote Neo-Geo video system, removing distinction between raster and non-raster games and cleaning up the code significantly [David Haywood].
- Improved DIP switches for clowns, clowns1 and bowler [Bob Seidel].
- Added CPUINFO_PTR_DEBUG_SETUP_COMMANDS: a callback that is invoked to tell CPU cores to set up commands specific to a CPU core [Nathan Woods].
- Added SegBase() and SegLimit() functions to the i386 core debugger [Nathan Woods].
- Improved sound balance in 'Night Slashers' [MAME Italia].
- Improvements to the Deco MLC games (added sprite buffering, fixed tile banking, fixed clear colour, added sprite clipping & ARM interrupt bug fix). The only thing left for this driver is really raster support for the pitch in 'Stadium Hero' [Bryan McPhail].
- Fixed 'Hang On' stereo sound routine [Mamesick].
- Cleaned up PC keyboard code [Nathan Woods].
- Added memory_install_* calls that are not specific to specific bus widths (only for static handlers, not for function pointers) [Nathan Woods].
- Added sound to Ping Pong Masters '93 [Tomasz Slanina].
- Converted 'Crazy Balloon' sound to use the discrete system [Derrick Renaud].
- Major Namco System 22 update [Phil Stroffolino]:
  * Hooked up the real master DSP BIOS.  Many games are now working or displaying graphics that were having problems before; removed many hacks as a result;
  * Hooked up the runtime-configurable interrupt handlers, removing more game-specific hacks;
  * Some improvements and additional documentation of video hardware;
  * Emulated Alpine Surfer protection and fixed bogus loading of Point ROMs, though the game still has problems.
- Fixed the Wild Western bonus screen, where the horse would not scroll into view [Nicola Salmoria].
- Cleaned up inputs in the bfm_sc2 driver [El Condor].
- Fixed in the old debugger the display of opcodes for word-addressed CPUs like the TMS32010, which was completely broken before [Alex Jackson].
- Separated debugger break key from OSD display. They can now be programmed differently. Also fixed behavior in the new debugger when using the break so that text doesn't get entered onto the command line [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed the handling of address masking and display within the debugger [Aaron Giles, Nathan Woods].
- Fixed order of operations in the expression engine if functions were used [Aaron Giles].
- Added timer support to the ADSP cores and hooked it up for the DCS games [Aaron Giles].
- Many Voodoo updates to add Voodoo Banshee and Voodoo 3 support [Aaron Giles].
