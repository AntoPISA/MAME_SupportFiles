Source changes:
---------------
- Added missing InitCommonControls(), which caused the debugger UI to fail with recent updates [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed dip switches and added second player controls for beaminv driver [stephh].
- Major rewrite of the SHARC core [Ville Linde]:
  * Bit-accurate reciprocals.
  * More accurate pipeline emulation.
  * Fixed the problems with operation latencies.
  * Regression tested a few floating-point operations for bit-accurate results.
  * Improved DMA emulation.
- This update will fix most (but not all) of the clipping problems in Gradius 4 and NBA Play by Play.
- Updated cardline driver lamps and layout [wolf676]:
  * Converted hardcoded fake lamps to new artwork system.
  * Added button lamps card1-5, collect, bet, start.
  * Added simple button lamps artwork "cardline.lay".
  * Re-ordered buttons and added "collect" button.
- Updated funworld driver lamps and layout [wolf676]:
  * Added external credit in counter (mapped as coin 1 counter).
  * Added external credit out counter (mapped as coin 8 counter).
  * Added button lamps hold1-5, cancel, start.
  * Added simple button lamps artwork "funworld.lay".
- Added COP420 core for the Altair games [Curt Coder].
- Increased the interleave in Xevious to fix synchronization issues [robiza].
- Added new output control system. This system is designed to support multiple output streams, and should replace all instances of printf in the code. You can now call one of these functions:

  mame_printf_error
  mame_printf_warning
  mame_printf_info
  mame_printf_debug

  to output data. By default, these go to the console, but they can be overridden by the OSD layer to route wherever is appropriate [Aaron Giles].
- Some additional 'Grand Champion' cleanup [Aaron Giles].
