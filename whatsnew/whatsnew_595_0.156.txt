New games/clones promoted from NOT_WORKING
----------------------------------------------
Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles (UK 4 Players, set 3) [caius, The Dumping Union]


Source changes:
---------------
- Added SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS for Arkanoid and Astrocorp HWs [Angelo Salese].
- Added SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS for Alpha 68k HW [Angelo Salese].
- Added dump of the sync prom at L8 to Drag Race [Matt].
- Skeleton driver for the PSE Desert Patrol, so to document the dumped PROMs [Dave Widel, gregf].
- rspdrc: Optimized accumulator access in multiply instructions [MooglyGuy].
- lpc: Skeleton ACPI [O. Galibert].
- pentium: More support of the magic 0x66 prefix [O. Galibert].
- More sane values for dec0.c/dec8.c screen raw parameters [Angelo Salese].
- i6300esb: Document more registers [O. Galibert].
- steppers: Move to emu/machine [Ramiro Polla].
- steppers: Add absolute position [Ramiro Polla].
- pentium: This is the kind of problems you find when a bios uses xmm4 as call stack [O. Galibert]
- pentium: Some stuff to make lindbergh go further [O. Galibert].
- pci: Add grossly hacked smbus [O. Galibert].
- Experiments in PCI land [O. Galibert].
- Fixed an annoying inconsistency between memory_share and memory_region: the width() method of the former returned the width in bits (8, 16, 32 or 64) while the width() method of the latter returned the width in bytes (1, 2, 4 or 8). Now both classes have a bitwidth() method and a bytewidth() method. Updated all callers to use whichever one was more appropriate. Also removed the implicit-cast-to-any-integer-pointer of memory_regions, which was rather unsafe (if you weren't careful with your * operators and casts it was easy to accidentally get a pointer to the memory_region object itself instead of to the data, with no warning from the compiler... or at least I kept doing it) Updated all devices and drivers that were accessing regions that way to use a region_ptr_finder when possible, and otherwise to call base() explicitly [Alex Jackson].
- The tilemap system now respects gfx_element::total_colors(). Fixed various drivers and devices that were using incorrect total_colors for GFX elements used in tilemaps [Alex Jackson].
- Added language ROM for 'Lunar Lander' [Mariusz Wojcieszek].
- rsp: Made the RSP interpreter core functional again [MooglyGuy].

- Added command-line option -[no]drc_log_native to control DRC  native diassembly logging.  This allows logging of DRC native disassembly without re-compiling [Oliver Stoneberg].
- calomega.c: Improve color emulation by analogy with tugboat.c (which is actually a heavily modified Cal Omega board) [Alex Jackson].
- SEGA YBoard: Mapping the port bits used to provide motor movement feedback [Felipe Sanches].
- naomi.c: Redumped F355 [Andy Geezer]
- pci: A little more, reaches an unemulated pslldq at fd228 [O. Galibert].
- Converted the various Hard Drivin' board types to be devices, allowing the side screens to be hooked up on Race Drivin' Panorama, which is now close to working (the side screens fail when selecting one of the car types) [David Haywood].
- rspdrc: Added undocumented ops VADDB, VACCB, VSUBB, and VSUCB [MooglyGuy].
- rspdrc: Fix crash on Linux when recompiling BREAK opcode [MooglyGuy, Firewave].

- Galaxy Force II: Mapping the port bits used to provide motor movement feedback signals such as Up/Down/Left/Right limit switches [Miodrag Milanovic].
- i386: Call with expand down stack [Carl].
- i386: GP fault with softint in v86 mode when iopl < 3 [Carl].
- twin16.c: Rewrite video mixing based on PAL equations. Fixes sprite-bg priority in Devil World intro, and in Vulcan Venture later stages and ending [Alex Jackson].
- pic8259: Priority and sfnm [Carl].
- segaufo update: Added better layouts + made ufo800 work + added upd sound to ufo21 + misc fixes  [hap].
- Man pages (*nix): Fixed some typos and bumped version to 0.155.

Also, renamed Solar Warrior (xain.c) from solarwar -> solrwarr to allow this original game to use the setname "solarwar".  Added diplocations to both games [Tafoid].
- Added command-line option -[no]snapbilinear to control binlinear filtering for snapshots (enabled by default).  This is mainly for making testruns and debugging faster - could also be used to speed up -aviwrite usage though [Oliver Stoneberg].

- naomi.c [Arzeno Fabrice]:
  * HOTD2 Proto BIOS added
  * Label correction for Club Kart Prize.
- SDL: SDL2 is now the default except for OS/2 builds [R. Belmont].
- USE_NETWORK Ethernet emulation is now enabled by default as per the roadmap [R. Belmont].
- upd7220: Better output for the compis and dmv [Carl].
- gts3.c: Added switches. After setting up, the games are playable. Split into AN and DMD displays [Robbbert].
- gts80b.c: Display is working [Robbbert].
- model3: More rendering improvements [Ville Linde]:
  * Draw transparent triangles in a separate pass.
  * Implemented viewport priority.
- calomega.c: Fill in some unknown DIP-Switches [Brian Troha].
- amiga.c: use Aaron's memory_array class for bytewidth-agnostic access to chip RAM, instead of a driver-specific implementation. Also store the custom chip registers in an array instead of a memory share [Alex Jackson].
- calchase.c: Implemented missing DIP-Switch for 'Eggs Playing Chicken', promote to working. Press "S" to skip the CMOS error, "S" or wait to skip the emm386.exe error (not an emulation issue), use "Coin 2" to coin-up and start the game, and "1 Player Start" to brake.
- calchase.c, gamecstl.c, midqslvr.c, queen.c, savquest.c, taitowlf.c, voyager.c, xtom3d.c: Intel component is not MXTC, it's MTXC [Peter Ferrie].
- intelfsh.c: Added support for AMD 29F400T, AMD 29F800T and FUJITSU 29F160T [Jon Sturm].
- darius.c: Add DIP-Switch locations to the Darius sets and give the newly added US set the correction coinage [Brian Troha].
- Correct sound ROM for (tturf) 'Tough Turf (set 2, Japan, 8751 317-0104)' [ShouTime].
- Added region_ptr_finder, which works like shared_ptr_finder except it finds a ROM region instead of a memory share. Unlike the already existing memory_region_finder, these can be accessed without any overhead (since it's a pointer directly to the data and not to the memory_region object), can be whatever data type you want with no casting needed, and are strictly type-checked--if you have a required_region_ptr<UINT32> the region has to be a ROM_REGION32 (or an implicitly 32-bit region due to belonging to a device with a 32-bit bus) or the finder won't find it and will tell you why. Basically, region_ptr_finders are strictly better than memory_region_finders and all drivers using the latter should be converted over [Alex Jackson].
- Converted many sound devices to use a required_region_ptr to find their sample ROMs instead of looking up the region manually in device_start(). Note that this means that you can no longer get away with having e.g. an OKIM6376 without a ROM (as several slot machine skeleton drivers did); MAME will now complain at startup about the missing region, instead of just crashing the first time the chip tries to play a sound like it did before [Alex Jackson].
- twin16: Convert the scrolling layers to tilemaps (the fixed text layer was already one). Miscellaneous cleanups/modernizations [Alex Jackson].
- Don't execute a timeslice before loading a savestate from the command line [Alex Jackson].
- supduck.c: Fill in Lives, Demo Sounds and Game Sound dipswitches as well as add DIP-Switch locations [Brian Troha].
- Capcom updates: Fixed some incorrect info about the SF2 bootlegs and got them running better [any].
- Dumped 8571 MCU from a bootleg Top Secret/Bionic Commando PCB.
- k054156: Save state register all video RAM, including the optional "external linescroll RAM"; fixes Lethal Enforcers save states [Alex Jackson].
- More devfind: [Alex Jackson].
- i386: Move initialisation of m_lock to i386_common_init(), so that it is always initialised.
- i6300esb: More more more [O. Galibert].
