New Clone Added

Cluedo (prod. 2) [James Wallace]


MAME Testers Bug Fixed (1):
---------------------------
- dunhuang0120u3gra (Vas Crabb)


Source changes:
---------------
- Updated DIP locations in the following drivers [Vas Crabb]:
  * bublbobl.c: bublbobl, tokio;
  * cps1.c: all games;
  * dunhuang.c: dunhuang;
  * mario.c: marked all as active high (confirmed from manuals);
  * segag80r.c: astrob2, astrob1, spaceod and pignewt;
  * segag80v.c: all games, fixed switch ordering.
- Made more functions static to reduce namespace pollution [Atari Ace].
- Improvements to the Touchmaster driver, still labelled not working. You can actually play tm and tm3k, but sometimes you have to reset because they stop registering the touchscreen input. tm4k is protected and hence totally unplayable [Luca Elia].
- Fixed compilation problems with altivec accelerators [Vas Crabb].
- Fixed bug in Voodoo statistics accumulation [Atari Ace].
- Reverted to old behavior where even with -switchres disabled, MAME will use exclusive mode when rendering with Direct3D. This means some of the switching to/from fullscreen mode problems will come back, but should prevent confusion over poor performance by default [Aaron Giles].
- Made it a non-fatal error if we are unable to change a joystick to absolute mode in the Windows input code. Some drivers apparently freak out about this [Aaron Giles].
- Defined a couple more inline functions: div_64x32_rem and the unsigned equivalent divu_64x32_rem. Added inline implementations for GCC x86 and MSVC [Aaron Giles, Vas Crabb].
- Cleaned up timer interfaces. Created new module attotime which manages a new structure type attotime, equivalent to the old mame_time. All time math functions are now implemented in attotime and have been removed from timer.h. The following search/replace over the code has been made [Aaron Giles]:

  add_mame_times                -> attotime_add
  add_subseconds_to_mame_time   -> attotime_add_subseconds
  compare_mame_times            -> attotime_compare
  double_to_mame_time           -> double_to_attotime
  make_mame_make                -> attotime_make
  mame_time                     -> attotime
  mame_time_to_double           -> attotime_to_double
  mame_time_to_subseconds       -> attotime_to_attoseconds
  scale_down_mame_time          -> attotime_div
  scale_up_mame_time            -> attotime_mul
  sub_mame_times                -> attotime_sub
  sub_subseconds_from_mame_time -> attotime_sub_subseconds
  subseconds_t                  -> attoseconds_t
  time_never                    -> attotime_never
  time_zero                     -> attotime_zero

  DOUBLE_TO_SUBSECONDS          -> DOUBLE_TO_ATTOSECONDS
  HZ_TO_SUBSECONDS              -> HZ_TO_ATTOSECONDS
  MAME_TIME_IN_CYCLES           -> ATTOTIME_IN_CYCLES
  MAME_TIME_IN_HZ               -> ATTOTIME_IN_HZ
  MAME_TIME_IN_MSEC             -> ATTOTIME_IN_MSEC
  MAME_TIME_IN_NSEC             -> ATTOTIME_IN_NSEC
  MAME_TIME_IN_SEC              -> ATTOTIME_IN_SEC
  MAME_TIME_IN_USEC             -> ATTOTIME_IN_USEC
  MAME_TIME_TO_CYCLES           -> ATTOTIME_TO_CYCLES
  SUBSECONDS_TO_DOUBLE          -> ATTOSECONDS_TO_DOUBLE
  SUBSECONDS_TO_HZ              -> ATTOSECONDS_TO_HZ
  USEC_TO_SUBSECONDS            -> ATTOSECONDS_IN_USEC
   
  In addition, all the mame_timer_* functions have been renamed back to their original names timer_*, so it is timer_set() instead of mame_timer_set() once again. The mame_timer object itself has been renamed to emu_timer.
