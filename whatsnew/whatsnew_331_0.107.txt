Source changes:
---------------
- Added tile flipx to tilemaps in yunsung16.c (bomb kick needs it) and changed the DIP switches used for protection to real DIP switches [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Additional updates to the magicfly driver. Improved documentation and input port mapping [Roberto Fresca].
- Fixed assertion when the MAME window was minimized [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug that prevented resizing of secondary windows [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed crash in the PGM driver [David Haywood].
- Fixed default flicker value to 0 [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed gamma and brightness ranges in the UI to match the limits from the command line [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed keyboard inputs in the Taito Wolf driver [Ville Linde].
- Fixed scrolling in the palette view [Aaron Giles].
- Properly emulated the sprite overdraw effect in ninjakd2. Now you can see the "opening" effect and the previously 2 bugged levels are fixed. Converted the driver to use tilemaps as well [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Rewrote Missile Command driver from schematics [Aaron Giles]:
  * CPU speed now correct (slows down for lower 32 scanlines)
  * Proper frame rate and IRQ signal timing.
  * Service mode works on some sets, fails on others due to 6502 bug.
  * Accurate bitmap mapping and cycle counts for 3-bit accesses.
  * Using bitmap access PROM for bit mode writes.
