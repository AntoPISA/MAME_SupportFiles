Source changes:
---------------
- Basic Direct3D blitting support [Leon van Rooij].
- Fixes for Crashes introduced in last version.
- Mame Blitter Generation Code [Phil Stroffolino].
- Plenty of other things I just don't have time to list.
- SHA1 hash support, including various new command line options [Farfetch'd].
- Sound in Macross Plus & Quiz Bisyoujo Senshi Sailor Moon [Bryan McPhail].
- texture_management: use DirectX texture management (default is off, but some 3D cards need this (however, there's a small-ish speed-penalty)).
- The code manually imports the DirectDrawCreateEx() function so MAME compiled with d3d support will (or rather should, I've not actually tested that yet) still run on PC's with older versions of DirectX. It should work with pretty much any 3D hardware (except perhaps older Voodoo-based cards), and the speed should be similar to the DirectDraw blit (a bit faster for some older cards). -direct3d or -d3d: use Direct3D (default is off, overrides -dd); -filter or -flt: use bi-linear filtering (default is on);
- Various Konami Related Fixes and Improvements [Acho A. Tang, R. Belmont].
- Various System 32 Updates (Priority, SVF Pitch etc.) Note, theres a chance some things may be broken [Acho A. Tang, Jason Lo, David Haywood].
- You need DirectX7 headers and libs to compile it, I'm using the set from http://caesar.logiqx.com/html/tools/compilers/mingw.shtml which has the original MS headers (the same set is used for Allegro and FB Alpha) and I've made a minor update to the ddraw code so that it compiles with this set of headers (VC++ should still be fine as well).
