- Fixed protection in 'Devastators' and 'Blades of Steel' [Manuel Abadia].

- Alongside the AND key sequences introduced in the previous beta, it is now possible to have OR and NOT sequences. For recording OR key/joy sequences in the key/joy setup menu simply press UI_SELECT (usually ENTER) after the first recorded sequence. Don't press any UI_UP/UI_DOWN/UI_CANCEL keys beetwen the two sequences. To insert a NOT key/joy simply press it two times. The first obvious use for this is to wire button 1 to both the joystick and mouse button [Andrea Mazzoleni].

- New NES sound emulation for 'Punch Out' and 'Donkey Kong 3' [Matthew Conte, wwtk@mail.com].
