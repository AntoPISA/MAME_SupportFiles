Source changes:

- Fixed crash at the end of Gun Smoke level 3 [Paul Leaman].
- Fixed protection in Devastators and Blades of Steel [Manuel Abadia].
- Fixed protection in Slam Masters [Paul Leaman].
- Alongside the AND key sequences introduced in the previous beta, it is now possible to have OR and NOT sequences. For recording OR key/joy sequences in the key/joy setup menu simply press UI_SELECT (usually ENTER) after the first recorded sequence. Don't press any UI_UP/UI_DOWN/UI_CANCEL keys beetwen the two sequences. To insert a NOT key/joy simply press it two times. The first obvious use for this is to wire button 1 to both the joystick and mouse button [Andrea Mazzoleni].

- New NES sound emulation for Punch Out and Donkey Kong 3 [Matthew Conte, wwtk@mail.com].
