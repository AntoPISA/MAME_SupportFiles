  * Derived clocks where possible.
  * Complete memory maps from the schematics.
  * Hooked up proper sound command latching.
  * Reimplemented 6802-based ADPCM samples for the bootlegs.
  * Merged memory maps.
  * Extended NVRAM to the full RAM range (according to schematics).
  * Created common include file and modified drivers to use it instead of explicit externs.
- Removed msb/lsb handlers from taitosnd. Updated all drivers to call the 8-bit versions directly from the address maps [Aaron Giles].
- Did bulk replace of AM_READ/WRITE(SMH_NOP) -> AM_READ/WRITENOP [Aaron Giles].

  * Verified clock frequency (including 4KHz NMI).
  * Position 6A is not populated in JAPAN ver.
  * Sound tempo is wrong in all sets (with or without this change).
  * Clock for AY-3-8910 is 14.31818M/8 except for main melody.
