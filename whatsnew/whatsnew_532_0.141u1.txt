- raiden2: First stab at a cop "disassembler" [trap15, Olivier Galibert].
- Redo most of the DRC/backend support as C++. Yes, it is intentional that the x86/x64 backends compile everywhere. Backends are now derived from drcbe_interface and implement several required overrides. x86emit.h now uses namespaces so that the x86/x64 emitters can co-exist. New file uml.h/uml.c actually describes the UML language, separating out several concepts from drcuml.c [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned up clocks of mid to late 80s Nichibutsu non-Mahjong games. Though not completely accurate yet, this should improve music speed and DAC audio pitch a bit [hap].

  * Same for float registers F0,F1,F2,etc instead of FREG(0);
  * Dynamic integer/float regs use inline functions ireg(),freg();
  * MEM macro is now a lower-case inline function mem().
- Fixed a trivial boot vector program init bug in "Lethal Thunder" / "Thunder Blaster" [Angelo Salese].
- Added an opcode in "Mystic Riders" decryption table, makes BGMs to work in (mysticrib) [Angelo Salese].
- Added sound reset line for Irem M92 HW, and safely removed GAME_IMPEFECT_SOUND flag to Perfect Soldiers [Angelo Salese].
- Fix a bug in makedep which will caused includes on the first line of the file like in skyraid.h to be ignored [Couriersud].
- Added working sound to Dogyuun and V-Five Roberto Zandonà, Alex Jackson].
- toaplan2 improvements [Alex Jackson]:
  * Figured out which bit controls V25 RESET in each game by comparing the 68000 code;
  * Added a comment about fixeight's I/O map, which we'll have to determine once we start decrypting it;
  * Put #ifndef USE_ENCRYPTED_V25S around some simulation crap that was hiding in fixeight's DRIVER_INIT;
- segapcm.c: Fixed loop address, hangon engine sounds better now. Also included documentation in source of known register functions [hap].
- madalien.c: Fixed highlighting in tunnel [Qwi Jibo].
- Fixed regressed flip screen support in Toaplan 2 games [David Haywood].
- Changed the discrete sound system to be class based [Couriersud]:
  * Former modules are now classes being derived from discrete_base_node;
  * Moved all context variables to be private class members;
  * For "standard nodes", DISCRETE_CLASS_STEP_RESET provides a simple way to implement a node;
  * All information around a node (additional info struct, constants and input mappings may be defined on a class level centralizing all information. An example is dss_inverter_osc;
  * Significantly simplified the task handling;
  * Fixed a bug which would not buffer secondary outputs;
  * All lists in sound/disc_* are now based on dynamic_array_t (discrete.h);
  * Changed all drivers to reflect the changes;
  * Custom modules are now just another node class;
  * No performance hit observed due to these changes.
- Improvements to goldnpkr.c [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Lots of changes to get working the Video Klein games;
  * Renamed (witchcde) to (witchjol) --> Jolly Witch (Export, 6T/12T ver 1.57D);
  * Added Wild Witch (Export, 6T/12T ver 1.74A);
  * New video hardware and machine driver for Video Klein's extended tiles games;

  * Fixed port writes;
  * Implemented SCI status follower bits.
- toaplan2 [Alex Jackson]:
  * Found a few more fixeight opcodes, by matching code in the interrupt routines with (batsugun);
  * Corrected fixeight V25 address map (the YM2151 and OKI6295 are at a different location than the other games);
  * Preliminary implementation of V25/V35 port output.
- Optimized RC_INTEGRATE and TRANSFORM. Nice improvement [Couriersud].
- Changed all "output[0] = ..." into "set_output(0, ..)" calls. Rewrote modules using "output[0]" as a latch as well. The purpose is to decouple nodes from the discrete infrastructure implementation [Couriersud].
- Added a virtual stream update function to the device sound interface. Added a new stream_create that takes fewer parameters and calls the device's stream update. Removed the stream update stub template. Updated BSMT2000 and OKIM6295 to use the new interface for their streams [Aaron Giles].
- fixeight: Hooked up EEPROM [David Haywood].
- Added preliminary working sound to beezer [Lord Nightmare].
- M6801 changes [Curt Coder]:
  * Implemented port 3 strobed mode;
  * Fixed port writes some more.
- Discrete subsystem now uses the sound_device stream_update function [Couriersud].
- Improve nmi handling in mouser [Couriersud].
- i8085.c: Fixed inte callback not being called when the IE flag was cleared after the CPU received an interrupt. This fixes interrupts in n8080.c helifire and spacelnc [Qwi Jibo].
- raiden2: Write down the rather weird results of a series of tests [dox, Olivier Galibert].
- Added "-syncrefresh" option to osd/sdl. This will *limit* the game speed to the video refresh rate and works in -mt mode as well. The option has an effect only if "-waitsync" is specified [Couriersud, Chris Kennedy],
- Fixed 01004: chinhero, chinhero2, chinherot: There is a bad sprite on level 7 of the game [Corrado Tomaselli, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]. Added sprites wrap around-y in Chinese Hero to fix gorilla sprites entering from the left [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].

- Changed the Analog Controls menu to only list controls selected in the Driver Configuration [Derrick Renaud].
- ARM7 updates [Tim Schuerewegen]:
  * Fixed "MOV x, R15, LSL #y" form as tested by ARMWrestler;

- NEC DSP updates [R. Belmont, byuu, Dr. Decapitator]:
  * Now supports uPD7725 and uPD96050;
  * Hooked up SNES common code to use uPD96050 for ST-010/011;
  * Removed ST-010 HLE simulation.
- Display suggestions in case commands that require game name are called and there were no matching games [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Carved out a discrete_sound_device from discrete_device. This now has all the stream related code. discrete_device thus now contains all the generic code and may be used going forward to implement not sound related use cases [Couriersud].
