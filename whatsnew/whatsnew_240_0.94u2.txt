  * Fixed IRQ handling to match schematics.
  * Hooked up watchdog, global mute.
  * Fixed IRQ2 timing
- segaxbd, tweaks:
  * Added hack to make GP Rider boot; input bug prevents full playability.

  * Fixed CPU speeds according to schematics.
  * Hooked up global mute.
  * Reduced interleave on all games.
- machine/segaic16.c: changed divide-by-zero case to return a value.
- vidhrdw/segaic16.c, several updates:
  * Implemented Y-board sprite priorities (not fully understood, but seems to work).
  * Found missing 8th bit in Outrun/X-board sprite pitch.
  * Implemented Outrun/X-board road priorities according to logic dump from Leopardcats.
  * Hooked up road RAM double buffering that was missing for 'Outrun'/'X-board'.
  * Disabled direct scanline mode for Outrun road, which doesn't support it.
- Fixed sample playback glitch.
- Fixed othunder sound clipping.
- Fixed 'Batrider' sound.
- Fixed 'Dream Shopper' crash.
- Added sound balancing assistance display to debug builds.
- cpuintrf.c cleanup.
- Removed some unwanted clamping code from sound core.
- Adjusted 'Frogger' volume.


Changes from Derrick Renaud:
---------------------------
- Added proper watchdogs to 'Bosconian', 'Galaga', 'Pole Position', 'Xevious'.
- Fixed "Wiggie Waggle' crash.
- Fixed some speaker settings.
- schaser: updated sounds to include missle effect and fix dot sounds per schematics.
- SN76477 emulation - fixed bug where gain was 3x more then it should be, causing effects to clip for 2/3rds of the time.
- SN76477 emulation: fixes the attack time for one-shot envelope mode.
- Fixed crash in crash, ripcord and robotbwl and added sample support to them.  Samples not currently recorded.
- robotbwl: added discrete simulation for footsteps.
- crash: added discrete simulation for beeper.


Changes from Nathan Woods:
-------------------------
- Added entries for two MESS specific sound cores.
- Changed wavwrite type from 'void *' type to an opaque pointer 'wav_file *'.
- This patch fixes a bug whereby the CPU could switch modes without entering the set of functions for that mode. Specifically, if a mode change occurs it will break out of the execute function and reenter the correct function.


Changes from Nicola Salmoria:
----------------------------
- Documented debug mode in 'TNZS'.
- Fixed some bad gfx in 'Sky Lancer'.
- Rebalanced 'Gyruss' volume.
- NMK004 sound simulation.
- playmark.c updates.
- Fixed sprite/tile priorities in 'World Beach Volley', and fixed SOME priorities in "Excelsior' - but not all of them, the high score screen is still wrong.
- Found bitmap enable bit, fixes girl pictures sticking in 'Big Twin' and 'Excelsior', and garbage graphics in 'Excelsior'.
- Added rowscroll support, fixes wbeachvl37b7gre.
- As previously noted, wbeachvl37b16gre could be a genuine bug of the original - I don't see how it could work otherwise.


Changes from Pierpaolo Prazzoli:
--------------------------------
- 'Super Slam' update.
- Fixed sprites.
- Fixed text tilemap colors.
- Fixed text tilemap scrolls.
- Fixed VSync.
- Fixed dips in 'Sky Lancer'.
- playmark.c update.
- Fixed dipswitches in 'Excelsior'.
- Tweaked bitmap scroll in 'Excelsior'.
- Changed bitmap to be drawn after the fg_tilemap (this is correct in 'Excelsior' and looks better in 'Big Twin', but looking at the service mode in 'Excelsior' some "good" bits are trasparent).
- Added "Continue" dipswtich in 'Big Twin'.
