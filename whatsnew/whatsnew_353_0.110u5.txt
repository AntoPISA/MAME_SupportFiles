Source changes:
---------------
- Added a "Digital Speed" of 0 in the "Analog Controls" menu. This will cause the control to only inc/decrement once per button press no matter how long the button is pressed. Remember this is still scaled by the "Sensitivity" setting. [Derrick Renaud].
- Added mosaic effect to valtric. Yes, it looks as bad on real hardwareas in MAME :) [Tomasz Slanina].
- Added new render texture format TEXFORMAT_YUY16, which is used to hold 4:2:2 Y/Cb/Cr format pixels. Updated the Windows Direct3D code and the software renderers to use this format directly [Aaron Giles].
- Added new render texture fromat TEXFORMAT_PALETTEA16, which is the same as TEXFORMAT_PALETTE16 but respects the alpha component of the palette entry. Updated the Windows Direct3D code and the software renderers to use this format [Aaron Giles].
- Added serial in/out support to the Amiga hardware. Added hooks for output pins and light pen positioning. Also fixed the horrible static at startup in the debug build [Aaron Giles].
- Added Sony LDP-1450 support [Aaron Giles].
- Added the final filtering stages to the sound, proper watchdog and memory mirroring to the circusc driver. Also added PORT_DIPLOCATION info and save state support [Derrick Renaud].
- Changed the render system to respect blendmodes for screen elements rather than hard-coding them. This allows individual VIDEO_UPDATE routines to do their own compositing [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned up the cclimber driver, replacing hacks for cannonb with a separate video update callback. [Mamesick].
- Fixed colors in 'Honey Dolls' [David Haywood].
- Fixed the background color in perfrman [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Improved DIP switches for Honey Dolls and Twin Adventure [Brian Troha].
- Improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver [Andrew Gardner]:
  * Implemented various dsp56k opcodes.
  * Polygonet Commanders now gets past the memory tests.
- Major funworld driver rewrite [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Merged/splitted some machine drivers, memory maps and inputs.
  * Unified get_bg_tile_info for all games.
  * Mapped the input buttons in a better format (all games).
  * Added proper color PROM decode routines.
  * Splitted the driver to driver/vidhrdw.
  * Corrected the screen size and visible area to magiccrd.
  * Added the remaining 2 GFX planes to magiccrd; GFX are imperfect.
  * Royalcrd: Added all inputs and DIP switches.
  * Fixed jolycdcr gfx to 4bpp.
  * Other fixes to get jolycdcr running.
  * Managed royalcdb to work, using the 2nd half of program ROM.
  * Managed jolycdit to work, but with imperfect graphics.
  * Fixed CPU clock to 2MHz. in all remaining games.
  * Fixed ay8910 frequency based on elephfam audio.
  * Fixed ay8910 volume in all games to avoid clipping.
  * Reworked jolycdcr, jolycdit inputs.
  * Set jolycdat as bigdeal clone.
  * Added the bipolar PROM and GAL to jolycdit. 
  * Added color PROMs to cuoreuno and elephfam sets. 
  * Corrected jollycrd screen size and visible area.
  * Hooked, wired and decoded the color prom in jollycrd sets.
  * Wired and decoded the color prom in cuoreuno and elephfam sets.
  * Wired and decoded the color prom in royalcrd.
  * Hooked, wired and decoded the color prom in bigdeal sets.
  * Decrypted jolycdit gfx roms.
  * Decrypted jolycdae and managed the planes to show correct colors.
- Merged in some MESS-specific PC support code [Nathan Woods].
- Minor Unicode changes for the Windows code [Nathan Woods].
- Moved the ST-V protection related code into stvprot.c and added some notes about the decathlete protection and renamed stvhacks to stvinit, because it contains most of the inits as well as the speedhacks [David Haywood].
- Removed the "Autocenter Speed" menu entry for Analog Controls that do not use it [Derrick Renaud].
- Removed the illusion from the rendering system that you could pass in arbitrary palettes. The system palette is all that is supported [Aaron Giles].
- Reorganized the laserdisc support a bit to accommodate new players.
- Scaled Windows mouse Z axis by 30 to make it usable. Most mice inc/decrement by 120 for each wheel click. Some rare ones are 30. So this means for most mice, using a Sensitivity setting of 25%, you will get 1 inc/decrement for each wheel click [Derrick Renaud].
- Updated vconv.c to support preprocessor and assembly file output in MSVC builds [Nathan Woods].
