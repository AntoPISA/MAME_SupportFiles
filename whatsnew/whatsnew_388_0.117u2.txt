Source changes:
---------------
- Imola GP updates [Phil Stroffolino]:
  * Renamed from (monzagp);
  * The leds are fully mapped;
  * Fixes for blitter modes, that affect the "tunnel" area;
  * DIP switch/port fixes; game now starts in attract mode, rather than immediately starting;
  * placeholder (handpicked) colors.
- Updated DIP switches for topland & ainferno according to their manuals [Fabio Priuli].
- More SH-4 core improvements [Samuele Zannoli]:
  * Fixes some problems in the disassembly and instruction execution from the previous patch;
  * Adds interrupt management;
  * Implements register bank switching;
  * Adds RTC timer counters;
  * Adds memory refresh timer;
  * Adds three timers of the TMU;
  * Adds a configuration structure that specifies the processor mode pin settings;
  * Internal processor clock frequencies calculated from mode pins and CPU clock;
  * Systems using the sh4 processor secify its configuration structure.
- Fixed some DIP switches in (littlerb) [Sonikos].
- Made some minor code quality changes across the code [Atari Ace]:
  * Avoided exporting a few global variables;
  * Fixed variable names that conflicted with typedef names;
  * Removed some shadow variables that were bugs or unnecessary;
  * Removed extraneous #defines.
- Fixed up sc61860 core, f3853 core, and pckeybd.c to work with new timing code [Nathan Woods].
- More TIA improvements [Wilbert Pol]:
  * Fixed some minor missile graphics positioning issues;
  * Moved some initialization code from tia_init to tia_reset.
- Fixed a few errors related to headers in the source code. Added missing self-includes, removed dead prototypes, and added location comments in headers in mame/includes. In a few cases the audit showed items that didn't need to be exported so they were made static [Atari Ace].
- Cleaned up the inputs in gdrawpkr and changed the hold buttons to "discard" since they are in fact discard buttons [Roberto Fresca].
- Added support for 14- and 16-segment LED displays to the MAME artwork system [Dirk Best].
- Fixed button 4 of player 2 inputs in bloodwar [Barry Harris].
- Connected S14001A speech to the wolfpack driver [Lord Nightmare].
- Fixed incorrect implementation of SSIO volume controls in the MCR driver. This makes the engine sound in "Spy Hunter" audible again, among other things [Ernesto Corvi].
- Added support back for the "none" option for the various *_device options [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed HD6309 dissaembly of the post-byte for ,W++ and ,--W [Captain Ahab].
- Updated the 6532 riot interface to be more like the 6522via and 6821pia interfaces [Wilbert Pol].
- Improved -listxml output to reflect new BIOS flag. New attribute isbios="yes" indicates that a given game is a BIOS [Aaron Giles].
- Further tweaks to the game selection UI [Aaron Giles]:
  * Disabled the tab key
  * Added hook for general input configuration from the menu;
  * Split set names from friendly names into left/right columns;
  * Added a background to the descriptive names of clones;
  * If you start with the game selection menu, hitting Esc to exit a game brings you back to the menu rather than quitting immediately;
  * Fixed logic so that INI files are reloaded for each game.
- Moved INI file handling fully into the core. As a side-effect of this change, <exename>.ini is no longer parsed. Changed -createconfig to always output mame.ini instead of <exename>.ini as a result [Aaron Giles].
- Renamed run_game() to mame_execute(). The game driver is no longer specified as a parameter; rather, this information is extracted from the options via OPTION_GAMENAME [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed raw input-based lightgun buttons [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned up options.c code. Added priority levels to options as they are set. New options are only accepted if they have greater or equal priority to a previous change. Added new function options_revert() to revert options below a given priority to their defaults. Changed options_get_string() so that it always returns a valid string (never NULL). Invalid strings are returned as empty strings [Aaron Giles].
- Added new functions core_filename_extract_base() and core_filename_ends_with() to corefile.h [Aaron Giles].
- Changed menu rendering a bit. Added a background hilight to more strongly emphasize the current item. Added rendered arrows to indicate more items on the top/bottom and to indicate selection options in the DIP switch menus. Changed hilighting to be a bit less garish. Fixed repeat rates on keys to no longer be tied to the framerate [Aaron Giles].
- Added support for page up/page down generically in menus. Also made pause toggle work while menus are visible [Aaron Giles].
- Changed render_textures to allocate in a pool model, to avoid high memory overhead when allocating large numbers of textures (for example in the 14- and 16-segment LED displays) [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed a number of 64-bit compiler warnings [Aaron Giles].
