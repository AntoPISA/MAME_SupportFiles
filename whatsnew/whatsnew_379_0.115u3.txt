---------------------------
- connect4_0115u1ora [Luigi30]


Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed PIA numbers in revamped Spiders driver [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Updated TIA graphics code is the code from the MESS repository. Also updated tourtabl driver to accommodate the changes [Wilbert Pol].
- Fixed Space Firebird so that the sprites are opaque with respect to each other and bullets, but transparent with respect to the star field [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed subtle behavior in handling of PIA port A. This allows for the removal of hacks in the Qix driver and the Williams driver [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Cleaned up the tilemap get_info callbacks [Atari Ace]:
  * Regularized and clean up the existing callbacks.
  * Changed some callbacks to use int tile_index as the parameter so that all callbacks use consistent naming;
  * Folded some direct uses of tile_info.flags into calls to SET_TILE_INFO();
  * Changed the Konami drivers to manipulate the tile_info global only within the tile_get_info callbacks;
  * Replaced all the callback declarations with TILE_GET_INFO() wrappers;
  * Changed the interface to pass tile_info as a parameter and made tile_info a static variable only accessible inside tilemap.c.
- Significant changes to the berzerk driver [Zsolt Vasvari]:
  * Video timings, memory map and interrupt system implemented from schematics;
  * Hooked up colors according to the schematics as well. The colors changed significantly. For example the yellow robots are now more like a mustard color.
- More ARM wrestling [R. Belmont]:
  * Fixed error in carry propagation on ALU opcodes of the form ALU r1, r2, r3 SHIFTEROP #imm;
  * Fixed Thumb ADD instructions where the PC is involved;
  * Fixed LDMIA to mask off bits 0 and 1 of the destination address;
  * MSR instruction now properly respects processor mode and field code flags.
- Modernized the Beam Invaders, Clay Shoot, and Embargo drivers [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Changed the sound balance in Thunder Dragon 2 to match the original PCB. Also verified the 68000 clock [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Fixed several more opcodes in the encrypted Irem CPU [Robiza].
- Fixed disassembly of brset and brclr opcodes in the 68HC11 core [Phil Skuse].
- Fixed tilemap colors in the Konami ZR107 driver [Ville Linde].
- Fixed bug in INR/DCR opcodes in 8085 CPU core [allentown_john].
- Updated PIA interfaces to support masks for port A/B inputs. This allows proper behavior of unconnected pins, according to the specs. Updated a number of games to use the new interfaces [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed bug that failed to initialize all IRQ states in the 6809 core on a reset. Also fixed cycle timing and removed obsolete code from the core [Ernesto Corvi, Zsolt Vasvari].
- Cleaned up vec_mult implementation [Nathan Woods].
- Improved toratora driver [Zsolt Vasvari]:
  * Added SN76477 from the schematics, but it sounds terrible; no doubt the schematics are incorrect in many places;
  * Updated to the recent PIA changes.
- Fixed input.c to use osd_ticks() instead of clock() [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed bit calculation in 6526cia.c which broke joysticks in the C64 driver in MESS [Pete Rittwage].
- Improvements to the rd2tank driver [Zsolt Vasvari]:
  * Fixed colors, based on the Red Tank flyer;
  * Added AY8910's, sounds fine, but how exactly they are hooked up to the PIA is not fully understood;
  * Hooked up CRTC properly.
