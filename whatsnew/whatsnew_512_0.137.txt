MAME Testers Bug Fixed (1):
---------------------------
- 03533: [Debugger] All 68020 cpu based drivers: 68020 disassembler bug: a 32-bit address displacement's upper 16-bit is desappear (R. Belmont)


Source changes:
---------------
- snes.c: simplified drawing routines, added support for offset-per-tile, cleaned up the code [Fabio Priuli].
- H8/3334: add analog input ports [R. Belmont].
- snes.c: fixed remaining issues in hires modes [Fabio Priuli].
- snes.c: fixed serial joystick reads [Fabio Priuli].
- snes.c: slightly simplified palette handling [Fabio Priuli].
- Re-dumped oceanhun CROMs 5-16 as 64Mb [ANY].
- namcos23: Cleanups [Olivier Galibert].
- namcos23: Add dips [Olivier Galibert].
- snes.c: Added very preliminary driver_data class for snes based drivers (it only contains input-related items for the moment, because these are needed to add support for additional controller types in MESS) [Fabio Priuli].
- snes.c: Fixed Offset-per-tile graphics [jbo_85].
- snes.c: Fixed scrolling problems [Fabio Priuli].
- namcos23: More cleanups [Olivier Galibert].
- Implemented default EEPROMs to the following drivers [David Haywood]:
  * deco_mlc.c, esd16.c, gijoe.c, konamigx.c,moo.c, mystwarr.c, rabbit.c, rungun.c, tmnt.c, vendetta.c and xexex.c.
- Added support for the 'simple' rowscroll mode used by sams64_2 [David Haywood].
- Fixed Z80 DMA ready signal handling [Curt Coder].
- namcos23 update [R. Belmont, Guru]:
  * Updated Guru Readme;
  * More IRQ tests pass;
  * Gunmen Wars I/O board runs and syncs;
  * SH-2 shared RAM added for Gunmen Wars.
- Implemented default EEPROMs to Bubble Memories, Lethal Enforcers and Puzzle Time [David Haywood].
- Implemented default EEPROMs for GTIClub, Hang Pilot, Asterix, X-Men and Polygonet Commanders [David Haywood].
- Fixed the texture ROM loading/order in Wave Shark. Textures look better now, and the ROM check passes [David Haywood].
- namcos23: pass C422 IRQ test [R. Belmont].
- Added ARDY/BRDY signal read handlers to Z80 PIO [Curt Coder].
- Implemented 'key matrix' inputs in King Derby (1986 version) [Angelo Salese].
- namcos23 updates [R. Belmont]:
  * Preliminary SH-2 hookup for GMEN games. SH-2 boots and copies the loader to private RAM then jumps to it. Transfer protocol for main program not yet understood;
  * Final Furlong 2 has a GMEN board and camera; update it to use that subdriver.
- Implemented sound to King Derby (1986 version) [Angelo Salese].
- Implemented coins to King Derby (1986 version), game can be considered as working right now [Angelo Salese].
- namcos23 updates [R. Belmont]:
  * Hooked up start/coin/buttons for Gorgon;
  * Fixed Panic Park crash;
  * Enabled I/O board for timecrs2c so it can coin up;
  * Cleanup.
- SDL: fix Fortify-reported stack smash [Belegdol].
- New driver for Five Clown, from IGS. This is a dual 6502 system with CRT controller, AY8910 and OKI M6295. Main program, graphics and sound samples are encrypted [Roberto Fresca, Grull Osgo]:
  * Hooked both 6502 CPU's;
  * Hooked the M6845 CRT;
  * Decrypted main program and bulk GFX;
  * Decoded GFX and color PROM;
  * Hooked both PIA's 6821;
  * Worked inputs from the scratch;
  * Hooked DIP Switches banks 2 & 4;
  * Hooked proper interrupts for audio CPU;
  * Hooked the AY8910 latches;
  * Hooked the OKI6295;
  * Hooked DIP switches ports $C400 & $CC00;
  * Found the sound samples decryption algorithm;
  * Added NVRAM support;
  * Added a complete PCB layout;
  * Added game notes;
  * Added technical notes.
- z80sio: Added register access functions to prevent trampoline functions [Dirk Best].
- Fixed debugger memdump command [Robbbert].
- Improvements to the unkch1/4 sets [David Haywood].
- Decrypted the color prom in King Derby (1986 version) [Angelo Salese].
- Made device->tag and devconfig->tag into private member variables (m_tag). Added inline tag() function to return a const char * version. Updated callers to use this instead of directly accessing tag.cstr() which was awkward [Aaron Giles].
- snes.c: Fixed OAM overflow [jbo_85, Fabio Priuli].
- Improvements to funworld.c driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added external default NVRAM support to the following games: bottle10, bottl10b, elephfam, elephfmb, jollycrd, jolyc3x3, jolyccra, jolyccrb, jolycdev, jolycdib, jolycdit, jolyjokr, jolyjokra, jolyjokrb, lluck3x3, lluck4x1, magicrd2, pool10, pool10b, pool10c, pool10d, potgame, royalcrd, royalcdb, sjcd2kx3, tortufam, vegasfst, vegasfte and vegasslw.
  * Changed default settings for some games, now that NVRAM is loaded externally.
- Confirmed and hooked up i/o ports in Magical Tonic / Odds, doesn't work due of nested NMI [Angelo Salese].
- snes.c: refactored joypad inputs to be consistent with other input devices (used in MESS) [Fabio Priuli].
- Implemented NMI enable flag in Lucky 8 Lines and Magical Odds, fixes logic quirks in the latter [Angelo Salese].
- Improvements to Magical Odds graphics [David Haywood].
- Written a per-pixel function for the irq system in the ST-V driver, disabled by default [Angelo Salese].
- vimana, vimanan, vimana1 (toaplan1.c driver) [stephh]:
  * Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the M68000 code);
  * Improved MCU emulation to correctly handle coinage based on DIP Switches settings and Territory Jumper.
- Implemented sound NMI enable flag to the Munch Mobile driver [Angelo Salese].
- m680x0: show FPU registers in the debugger for 030+ [R. Belmont].
- 680x0: Improve disassembly for various FMOVE forms [R. Belmont].
- Slightly fixed interrupt handling and added SBIC and MUL opcodes to the Atmel AVR8 core [Harmony].
- Added FJMP/JMPF opcode to the SunPlus u'nSP core [Segher, Harmony].
- Performed an initial code cleanup pass on the N64 rendering code to make use of booleans and inline variable instantiation, and removed a number of unused variables that were exposed as a result of the latter [Harmony].
