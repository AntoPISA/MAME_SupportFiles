Source changes:
---------------
- Added a new device type for timers. Where applicable, added a parallel set of timer functions that take a device_config instead of an emu_timer. Added MDRV_TIMER_* macros to define the timers in the machine driver. Implemented both periodic and scanline-based timer variants. Modified Space Encounters and Centipede to make use of this feature. Going forward, this is the preferred way of creating periodic timers [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Renamed *_vbl_cb to *_vblank_callback [Aaron Giles].
- Magicfly updates [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Completed the component list & PCB layout;
  * Added technical references to register $63 (magicfly);
  * Switched crystal to new predefined format.
- Funworld updates [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added proper inputs to jolyc980;
  * Added temporary patch to allow bypass the "code" screen in jolyc980;
  * Updated technical notes.
- Changed exidy440_sound_command back to "UINT8." Since it's used by both 8-bit and 16-bit systems, the automatic allocation is not worth it if you need an ugly UINT16 ** cast. Removed deprecat.h from some of the exidy files [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed Air Buster bootleg from reseting because of the watchdog [Zsolt Vasvari].
- The on-screen "Reset by watchdog" message only appears in debug builds now [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed the top screen in the megatech games [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Added internal artwork for 'Gorf' [Mr. Do!].
- Fixed memory leak in clifront.c [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Added a crosshair_set_screen() to allow drivers to control which screen(s) on which crosshairs are displayed [Nathan Woods].
- Made it a fatalerror to registr save state callbacks at the wrong time if the current driver claims to support save states [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed chicken and egg problem with device_start callbacks [Aaron Giles]:
  * Added DEVINFO_INT_TOKEN_BYTES, which is queried before device startup. It should return the size of the structure that will be hung off of device->token. It must not return 0;
  * Changed the core device interface to allocate and zero a block of memory the size of DEVINFO_INT_TOKEN_BYTES before calling device_start. The pointer to this memory is already attached to device->token at the time device_start is called;
  * The primary motivation for this is to allow the device_start function to make internal calls and pass the device_config* around as if the object were fully constructed. Since the token is used to indicate whether or not a device is live, this makes the device "live" at the time device_start is called rather than after it completes.
- Moved per-screen initialization into DEVICE_START and per-screen cleanup into DEVICE_STOP in the core video implementation [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed render_target_get_minimum_size() to return nominal values if no screens are found [Aaron Giles].
- Alpha Denshi major update [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * Fixed Alpha 8201/830x MCU simulation;
  * All hacks from the equites driver removed;
  * Fixed equites restart position after going underground;
  * Fxed hvolume, splndrbt 2 players;
  * Removed hacks from exctsccr2;
  * Fixed CPU gameplay in shougi:
  - Added dump of Alpha 8201 MCU to games that use it (the ROM isn't used yet, HMCS44 CPU core needs to be written first);
  - Major cleanup of the mess in equites.c.
  * Many thanks to Corrado Tomaselli for precious hardware info;
  * Implemented bg perspective scrolling using PROMs;
  * Fxed sprite flip and disable;
  * Fixed bg color;
  * Converted bg to tilemaps;
  * Fixed fg banking;
  * Fixed screen flip;
  * Removed meaningless banking of player inputs;
  * Added UI adjuster for MSM5232 frequency;
  * MSM5232 volume control;
  * Fixed MSM5232 noise LFSR formula (done by Jarek Burczynski; thanks to Corrado Tomaselli for samples);
  * Changed MSM5232 emulator to output channels separately;
  * Added output of SOLO channels to MSM5232 emulator;
  * Fixed champbas inputs;
  * Merged talbot with champbas, some driver clenaup;
  * Fixed shougi inputs;
  * Switched exctsccb to use the correct gfx ROMs (matches screenshot found in 01058 exctsccb: Exciting Soccer bootleg should be placed in champbas.c);
  * Fixed sprite bpp in exctscrr, removed the horrible hacks that were used to fix colors and transparency;
  * Fixed sound clipping in exctsccr;
  * Added percussions to the equites.c games using samples; sound board emulation is still not complete. Cymbal hit and hi-hat are  missing; bassline is incorrect, and DAC output should be filtered.
- Fixed crash in spbactn [Zsolt Vasvari].
- In drawgfx, removed unneeded pen lookups. Did some code formatting clean-up [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed ninjakd2 PCM sample rate to match pcb measurement [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed chdman -extract to a physical drive on Windows [Aaron Giles].
- Added return value to video_screen_update_partial() indicating whether or not the VIDEO_UPDATE was called as a result [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed typo in pitnrun frequency [Corrado Tomaselli].
- DIP switch improvements [RansAckeR]:
  * 1945kiii.c, 88games.c and 40love.c: Made use of PORT_DIPUNKNOWN_DIPLOC.
  * 40love.c: Made use of PORT_INCLUDE
  * 8080bw.c: Added more dip locations; Made use of PORT_INCLUDE.
  * wilytowr.c: Added dip locations for atomboy/wilytowr; Fixed coin modes.
  * battlane.c, battlera.c, battlnts.c, bbusters.c: added dip locations.
  * battlnts.c: made use of PORT_INCLUDE; fixed unknown dip switch.
  * bbusters.c: added note regarding correct gun calibration.
  * bionicc.c: Added dip locations.
  * bladestl.c: Added dip locations, made use of PORT_INCLUDE.
  * blockade.c: made use of PORT_INCLUDE.
  * beezer.c: Added dip locations.
  * bfm_sc2.c: dip switch improvements, made use of PORT_INCLUDE.
- Converted the MPU4 driver to use an HD6845, as the Hitachi part was on the PCB, while also using it to generate the VBLANK, rather than hardcoding a value. Added the pulldown resistor to the network, and added all the conditional inputs. Please note that on the later Cabinet Types (Ready Steady Go-1 onwards), the 10p slot is locked out (location of the true register for this is unknown), but the input setting is correct - you have to use Coin 2 or higher to get money in [James Wallace].
- Fixed "garbage" (newlines) in the debugger window when debugging the SH-4 CPU [Oliver Stoenberg].
