These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Accurate colors in Gunsmoke [Paul Swan, Nicola Salmoria].
- Colors in Super Basketball should now be correct for real (the opponent's shirts weren't changing color in each level) [Marco Cassili, Nicola Salmoria].
- Accurate colors in Vulgus [Pete Ground, Mirko Buffoni].
- Background in Millipede [Brad Oliver].
- Fixed sprites in Gunsmoke [Nicola Salmoria].
- Emulation of AVG sparkling bit (Tempest stars/fireworks) [Brad Oliver].
- Fixed sprites and background in Sidearms. Colors should be correct as well. There probably is another scrolling background missing [Nicola Salmoria].
- A note about Zaxxon colors: we are aware that they are wrong. The reason is that we are using the Super Zaxxon color PROM. As soon as we'll have the correct Zaxxon color PROM, they will be fixed.
- Better colors in Eggs [Petter Sjölund].
- Appropriate blue background in Scramble, Super Cobra and other games running on the same hardware [Mike Coates].
- Fixes to Star Wars brightness [Bernd Wiebelt].
- Added the background starfield to Bosconian [Martin Scragg].
- Slightly better colors in Locomotion [Gonzalo Casas].
- Fixed character colors in Black Tiger [Michael Appolo].


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------
- Changed the way 8910 sound is updated: there's no longer a fixed "updates per frame" value defined in the driver, instead the audio is stream is generated whenever a chip register is written to (and at every vblank). This improves sound quality in several games [Nicola Salmoria].
- Same change to the POKEY interface [Aaron Giles].
- YM2203 emulation not using the SoundBlaster OPL3 chip. This is more accurate than the previous one, which used the SoundBlaster OPL chip, however it is also slower. You can still revert to the old behaviour using the -fm command line option [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- YM2151 emulation [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Completely rewritten the 8910 emulator and interface. This affects a lot of games, but the one which benefits more is Gyruss: it now plays many sound effects which were missing [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Fabrice Frances, Nicola Salmoria, Pete Ground].
- Full emulated sound in Gyruss. You can remove all the samples, they are no longer needed. Also, music tempo should now be correct. Due to the increased emulation overhead, it now runs slower than before. To improve speed, you can use the new -sr option (see below) to lower the sample rate [Nicola Salmoria].
- Cleaned up the SN76496 emulation, now it is similar to the 8910 one and all games use Tatsuyuki's code. This affects several games, most notably the Mr. Do! series [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Nicola Salmoria].
- 8039 emulator, and _emulated_ sound in Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr.  and Mario Bros. Since the boards also use discrete circuits to generate sound, some samples are still needed to get complete sound support. Also partial sound in 'Radarscope' [Ron Fries, Dan Boris, Mirko Buffoni].
- Sound (through samples) in 'Yie Ar Kung Fu' [Phil Stroffolino, Kevin Estep].
- Completely rewritten the Namco waveform audio subsystem. This gets rid of some artefacts in 'Pac Man' (eating a ghost) and 'Ms Pac Man' (eating dots while a fruit is bouncing) [Nicola Salmoria, Aaron Giles].
- TI TMS5220 emulator. This handles speech in 'Star Wars' and other games [Frank Palazzolo].
- Speech in Discs of Tron [Aaron Giles].
- Sound in Three Stooges. Actually the code had always been there, it just had to be activated [Fabrice Frances].
- Music tempo in Scramble, 'Frogger', 'Amidar' and derivatives should now be correct [Frank Palazzolo].
- Music in Spy Hunter, sound in 'Rampage' [Aaron Giles].
- Sound in Qix [Aaron Giles].
- Sound in Super Basketball [Nicola Salmoria].
- Sound in Rastan [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Sound in Naughty Boy and 'Pop Flamer', using the 'Pleiads' driver. Not very good, but it's a start [Brad Oliver].
- Sound in Espial [Brad Oliver].
- Fixes to Missile Command [Eric Anschuetz].
- Music in Phoenix, via samples [Brad Oliver].
- Partial emulated sound in Bubble Bobble (only the YM2203 chip, therefore only some sound effects - no music) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Sound in Coors Light Bowling [Nicola Salmoria].
- Better tempo and pitch in Blue Print [Alan J McCormick].


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------
- Fixed Asteroids [Brad Oliver].
- Legendary Wings, Section Z, Espial, Black Tiger, Gunsmkoke [Juan Carlos Lorente].
- Fixed Popeye [Juan Carlos Lorente].
- 1943 [Jeff Johnson].
- Tac/Scan, Star Trek, pacmanbl, Red Ufo [Valerio Verrando].


Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- A note about Tempest: Several people complained that mouse control is reversed. This is not the case. The more obvious place where this can be seen is the level selection screen at the beginning: move the mouse right, the block goes right. Anyway, you can now reverse the controls (see below).
- Radarscope works [Andy White].
- Dirty rectangles support in 'Qix', all Williams games, 'Cloak & Dagger', 'Berzerk', 'Arabian', 'Space Invaders' and clones, 'Kangaroo', 'Space Panic', 'Warp Warp' [Aaron Giles].
- Some tweaks to DIP switches in the 'Super Cobra', 'Lost Tomb' and 'Rescue' driver [James R. Twine].
- Fixes to DIP switches and input ports in several games [Marco Cassili].
- Space Panic supports rotation [Mike Coates].
- Fixed Invinco (it was missing a ROM) [Mike Coates].
- Framerates in the Atari vector games should now be correct [Neil Bradley].
- In Cloak & Dagger, the background bitmap is now aligned properly with the playfield graphics, and boxes no longer get stuck at the corners of the conveyors [Dan Boris].
- Added the missing third button to 'Sidearms' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Spy Hunter displayes an extra line of text at the bottom indicating the status of the lamps that were on the arcade machine [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed Bosconian crashing: This was the speech processor being used for a protection check [Martin Scragg].
- Alternate controls in Defender and Stargate, to control the ship using the standard 8-way directional controls instead of up/down/reverse/thrust. Available only when the -cheat option is specified [Maurizio Zanello].
- Alternate controls in Battle Zone, Sarge, Defender and Stargate are available only when the -cheat option is specified [Nicola Salmoria].


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------
- Right control and right alt work again [Nicola Salmoria].
- Enhancements to the analog input controllers emulation. Their keyboard counterparts can be changed, the sensitivity adjusted, and the direction reversed. This is all controlled by the analog setup menu [Brad Oliver].
- Support for true analog joystick input in games like Star Wars; moreover, the whole range of joystick types supported by Allegro is now supported. To handle that, use the new command line option -joy N, where N can be

  0 - normal 2 button joystick
  1 - CH Flightstick Pro
  2 - Stick/Pad with 4 buttons
  3 - Stick/Pad with 6 buttons
  4 - dual joysticks
  5 - Wingman Extreme (or Wingman Warrior without spinner)

  * Press F7 to calibrate the joystick. Calibration data will be saved in mame.cfg. If you're using different joytypes for different games, you may need to recalibrate your joystick every time.
  * Note that if you enable joystick support, games like Star Wars will work ONLY with the joystick - mouse emulation will be disabled [Bernd Wiebelt].
- When the -vsync option is specified, the program checks whether the video mode is compatible with it (i.e. whether the video refresh rate is a multiple of the target frame rate), and fails otherwise. Some sensible default values for -vgafreq are built-in and automatically picked when -vsync is requested. It is also possible to successfully use -vsync with scanline video modes. Note that for VESA modes you might have to configure your card in order to make it use the 60Hz refresh rate [Nicola Salmoria].
- Support for default configuration file. Start MAME with the -saveconfig parameter, and the current configuration will be saved to mame.cfg, becoming the default. You can still override the mame.cfg settings giving parameters on the command line [Valerio Verrando].
- Modified the tweaked video modes to be as close as possible to 60Hz. However please note that on some systems the new modes might not work, while the old do. You can work around that by changing the line syncedtweak=yes to syncedtweak=no in mame.cfg [Valerio Verrando].
- The default directory for screen snapshots (F12) is now PCX instead of the current directory, so make sure you create it or snapshots will not be saved [Valerio Verrando].
- New command line options, -sr N, where N is the required audio sample rate, and -sb N, where N is the number of sample bits (8 or 16). For example

  mame gyruss -sr 22050 -sb 16

  will use a 22kHz sample rate and 16 bits. The -sb option currently doesn't change anything because none of the audio subsystems support 16 bit samples [Nicola Salmoria].
- You can keep the ROMs in a subdirectory called "ROMS", if you want to. When loading ROMs for 'gamename', the program will look in these directories in this order:

  1) gamename
  2) gamename.zip
  3) ROMS\gamename
  4) ROMS\gamename.zip

  * The same applies to samples, you can put them in a subdirectory called SAMPLES - therefore separating them from the ROMs [Nicola Salmoria].
- Samples can also be loaded from a common directory for variations of the same hardware. For example, all Space Invaders clones will load samples from the invaders directory [Valerio Verrando].
- In the DOS version, dirty rectangles are supported in all resolutions [Bernd Wiebelt].
- Several changes to the cheat subsystem [James R. Twine, Marc Lafontaine].
- Fixed bug in drawgfx() which caused Crazy Climber's big sprites to be corrupted when horizontally flipped [Vince Mayo].
- New options, -record and -playback. They allow you to record, and later playback, joystick input. Useful to document certain bug reports, or to show your friends how good you are ;-)
- New option -romdir which allows to specify a different directory where to load the ROMs from [Mike Balfour].
- High score and configuration save now support ZipFolders/ZipMagic to directly use .zip archives. If you want to use this feature, make sure there are no HI or CFG directories, otherwise the files will be saved there, not in the.zip archive [Valerio Verrando].


Source changes:
---------------
- Added a cpu_reset() call so that a single processor can be reset during execution; Gauntlet needs this to work properly [Aaron Giles].
- Centralized dac.c for dac sound emulation. Several dirvers use it [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- cpu_setbankhandler_r() / cpu_setbankhandler_w() for better bank switching support. The Williams drivers take advantage of it [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Integrated debugger. You must compile with MAME_DEBUG defined to activate it. Start MAME with the -debug option, then press tilde to enter the debugger [Martin Scragg, John Butler, Aaron Giles].
- Now using Allegro 3.0 - this fixed problems 0.29 had under NT with mouse enabled.
- Original, security chip version of the Sega G-80 vector games (note that the versions previously supported have all been removed) [Brad Oliver]:

  * Eliminator (2 and 4 players)
  * Space Fury
  * Star Trek
  * Tac/Scan
  * Zektor
  
- Redesigned cpuintrf.c to be more modular and readable [Aaron Giles].
- Removed samples field from the MachineDriver structure; added sound_prom field to the GameDriver structure [Nicola Salmoria].
- Some changes to the 68000 emulator memory interface, and a new 68000 disassembler. Improved the 68000 cpu interface [Aaron Giles].
- The 6502 supports bank switching via cpu_setbank() [Aaron Giles].
