Source changes:
---------------
- Added CDP1863/CDP1864 sound devices for MESS [Curt Coder].
- Noraut discrete sound system: Changed C1 value (from PPI-1 PC6 line and Darlington array) to match the real value, as seen on the PCB. This should reproduce the 555 output accurately [Roberto Fresca].
- Remove Enable input from a number of discrete sound modules [Couriersud, Derrick Renaud].
- Reverted driftout workaround, see latest comments here for reason: 
http://www.mametesters.org/view.php?id=3356 [hap].

Naomi/AW updates:
 * Hooked up protection for Power Stone 2 and Toy Fighter 
    [R. Belmont, Guru, Cah4e3]
 * Redumped bad ROM in Heavy Metal Geomatrix [Guru]
 * Redumped bad roms in Virtua Fighter 4 (cartridge version) [Guru] 
 * Redumped Club Kart: European Session [Guru]
 * Updated Atomiswave hardware documentation [Guru]

Verified CPU clocks for Atomic Point [Stefan Lindberg]

New driver for Amatic encryped gambling hardware. This system is based 
on a custom CPU. Graphics are decoded but only 2 bitplanes hooked. All 
the needed devices are in the driver, but commented out till can 
properly decrypt the program ROMs and identify the CPU. About the 
encryption scheme, see the driver notes about my findings. 
[Roberto Fresca]

Added device_find_child_by_tag helper function [Curt Coder].

i386: improved handling of override prefixes after a rep instruction 
[Gabriele Gorla]

Corrected Mirax clock frequencies [Stefan Lindberg]

lr35902 cpu core changes: [Wilbert Pol]
 - Improved handling of the DI+HALT bug.
 - Do not clear the interrupt flag when the cpu is halted and no 
    interrupt is taken.

m68k: don't save signal contexts on *BSD and Mac OS X.
  [scarlet, R. Belmont]

Correct bprom name in Hellfire sets and added documentation of the 
type of bprom used [Brian Troha].

Added deletion of MSVC specific files to clean task [Curt Coder].

z80dma improvements [Angelo Salese]:
 - Added Initiate read sequence command and hooked up basic status 
    reading
 - Added continue and reset port A/B timing commands
 - Added enable/disable irq, force ready and reinitialize status byte 
    commands
 - Fixed Initiate read command
 - Implemented reset command
 - Implemented fixed port transfer behaviour
 - Added decrement step mode and fixed a conceptual bug with portA 
    writes
 - Added preliminary search mode support and fixed a bug with WR3 
    mask byte
 - Fixed ready flag when the DMA disabled/enabled commands are used

"=A" inline assembly seems to be only supported on 32bit gcc. Provide 
a 64bit safe version of _get_profile_ticks. [Couriersud]

Ported Capcom CX4 implementation over from bsnes (original code by 
zsKnight, anomie and Nach). Mega Man X2 and X3 are now playable in 
MESS, with bugs. [Harmony]

Partially implemented TMS5110_CMD_TEST_TALK: [Couriersud]
 - according to the documentation, this needs to be issued to read 
    status on CTL1
 - cvs driver needs this

[SNES] Fixed a bug in our DSP1 emulation. Super Mario Kart can be 
played again in MESS. [Fabio Priuli]

CVS improvements: [Couriersud]
 - hook up speech cpu
 - get rid of "temporary" code which hardwire ctl & pdc writes
 - use tms ROM clock as sense input for the s2650. darkwar now speaks 
    again on startup.
 - only one latch used for sound & speech.
 - hooked up 393Hz signal to "dac3"
 - pcb pictures indicate discrete logic on the sound board. Marked 
    all games as GAME_IMPERFECT_SOUND since we seem to miss some sounds
 - 4bit dac remains mysterious

tms5110 improvements: [Couriersud] 
 - Implement ctl port input/output for status reads.
 - Input/output is switched by clocking pdc after a TALK STATUS 
    command.
 - update drivers to support new tms5110_ctl_r 
 - now exhibits Rom Clock signal

ym2612/3834: updates to track latest knowledge [Eke-Eke, Nemesis]
 - Moved LFO vars inside the chip struct
 - Changed SSG-EG to update before channel calcs

Fixed various issues with the dsp56156 disassembler.  [Andrew Gardner]

Updated nova2001 driver to use DIP LOCATIONS.  Clarified and verified 
switch behavior, comparing to manuals where available. [Fujix, Tafoid]

Fixed disassembly of NEG Rd,Rs instruction in ARM7TDMI Thumb mode.
[Harmony]

Fixed S-DD1 support in SNES driver; Street Fighter Alpha 2 is 
playable, Star Ocean shows decompressed graphics before hanging.
[Harmony]

S2650 improvements: [Couriersud]
 - Added S2650_FO_PORT fake port for flag output line.
 - Made CHECK_IRQ_LINE an inline
 - Verified irq handling (with help from Quench)

Complete dump of Planet Harriers [Guru].

Ported SPC7110 support from bsnes. [Harmony]

Ported ST010 support from bsnes. [Fabio Priuli]

Fixes an issue where running ST010 games would hang MESS. [Harmony]

Some progress with protection emulation for herbiedk and 8ballact.
No more game specific program counter checks. [Couriersud]

Support external baud rates in the MC68681 DUART [R. Belmont].

Implemented a RS and WS line interface for tms5220: [Couriersud]
 - this emulates the RS/WS and READY handshaking according
    to the tms5220 manual. Drivers reading the ready line
    should most probably use it. 
 - Note: For cases where the READY handshake is done by the cpu
     sufficient cycles have to be burnt to simulate that the
    cpu waited. This yet has to be implemented.

zaccaria.c updates: [Couriersud]
 - Remove tms5220 kludge
 - hooked up new RS/WS/READY tms5220 interface
 - removed dac1 as well. Replaced it by attenuation control for ay2, 
    channel B

Made INI file order explicit via priorities. [Rene Single]

Fixed F6 cheat toggle behavior. [Pugsy]

Corrected clocks for V-five pcb [Corrado Tomaselli].

Added byte swap to the cheat search. [Sandro Ronco]

Now allow for banks to take up half of the available slots. Explicit 
banks now work up to bank 64. [Aaron Giles]

Changed all tms5220 lines to (READ|WRITE)_LINE_DEVICE_HANDLER:
[Couriersud]
 - Added q suffix to denote active low lines
 - Updated all drivers accordingly.
 - Removed some trampoline functions

Added TMS5220C variant to tms5220.c. [Lord Nightmare].
 - implemented reset for TMS5220C if /RS and /WS are pulled down 
    together
 - Inserted LNs email and corrections as comment into source
 - Created a TODO section.

Updated gauntlet and firefox to use "new" tms5220 interface.
[Couriersud]

Discrete Updates: [Derrick Renaud]
 - Added DISCRETE_LOGIC_SHIFT - generic shift register
 - Fixed DISCRETE_BIT_DECODE to apply proper voltage instead of 
    clipping to INT.

tin the test cartridge [Angelo Salese].

Further simplifications to Atomiswave's keys. [Andreas Naive]

i8085 [Curt Coder]:
 - RIM instruction now shows the current status of RST5.5 and RST6.5 
    pins.

dkongjr now uses parallel discrete tasks. [Couriersud]

Removed a number of #ifdef LSB_FIRST in favor of macros that do the
equivalent. [Atari Ace]

 - Renamed p1 in mslug4, see notes

Added dipswitches for the photon2 coins, you can now select between 1 
and 6 minutes per coin. Also added information about the original 
games that these have been bootlegged from [David Haywood].

listxml changes: [Oliver Stoeneberg]
 - adds an "optional" flag for rom/disk entries to -listxml output
 - removed the obsolete "dispose" flag from the DTD in the -listxml
    output
