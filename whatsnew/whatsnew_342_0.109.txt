Source changes:
---------------
- Added new osd function osd_break_into_debugger() which can be hooked to cause a break into the OSD's debugger when an assertion or fatal error occurs. Hooked it up on Windows to do just that [Aaron Giles].
- Changed artwork loading to be on-demand rather than all up-front. Also added a message during artwork resizing/loading so it's more clear what is going on [Aaron Giles].
- Changed disassembler override callbacks to match new disassembler syntax [Nathan Woods].
- Changed input port calculations to go in two passes, to catch out-of-order conditionals properly [HobbesAtPlay].
- Fixed ES5503 behavior for voice volumes > 127 (cures missing sounds/music notes in several Apple IIgs demos and games) [R. Belmont].
- Fixed PNG code so that it doesn't NULL terminate tEXt chunks [Mathis Rosenhauer].
- Fixed priorities in the m62 driver, mainly affecting Lode Runner sequels [robiza].
- Input port cleanup and additional comments in the CPS1 driver [steph].un 
- Made MSC1937 operation more accurately match datasheet and wiring diagram. Added indexed getters to the output system to match the newly introduced setters [El Condor].
- More merit, getrivia, and findout improvements [wolf676]:
  * Added external coin counters and coin lockouts;
  * Fixed lamps in upright and cocktail modes;
  * getrivia.c: fixed sound in selection and clone;
  * Located ticket out bit in trivia games and commented it in both drivers;
  * Fixed merge collision from u5.
- Normalized exit codes from mame.exe. The core-specific ones are defined in mame.h. The Windows build will also return code 100 on an unhandled exception now [Aaron Giles].
