--------------------------------------


New Games Supported or Promoted from GAME_NOT_WORKING Status
------------------------------------------------------------
Dodgem [Mike Coates, Pierpaolo Prazzoli] (no sound, the video hardware emulation was also rewritten for this driver, its quite slow now but more accurate)
Lady Frog [Tomasz Slanina] (old 'ladyfrog' set (not working) renamed to 'roldfrog' (Return Of Lady Frog))
Main Event (SNK) [Tomasz Slanina] (controls probably need work)
Sundance [Stefan Jokisch] (controls now emulated)

New Clones Supported or Promoted from GAME_NOT_WORKING Status
-------------------------------------------------------------
Cloak & Dagger (International Versions, Spanish, French, German) [Aaron Giles]
Dig Dug (newer Atari rev) [Aaron Giles]
Lunar Battle (prototype, later) (clone of gravitar) [Aaron Giles]
Route X (bootleg) [David Haywood]
Sub Hunter (clone of depthch) [Stefan Jokisch]
Tempest (rev ?) [Aaron Giles]

New Non-Working Games/Clones Supported
--------------------------------------
Gorkans [Tomasz Slanina] (gameplay works but there are no good gfx roms)
Marine Date [insideoutboy] (collisions not emulated + various other issues)
Task Force Harrier (Japan) [David Haywood]
Various Sf2 bootlegs [David Haywood] (Please note, I have no intention of fixing these, however if you want to try and think you can do it in a clean way then feel free)
Whizz [Tomasz Slanina] (main program ROM appears to be bad, maybe a gfx ROM too)


Source changes:
---------------
- TESTDRIVERS still enabled (see note for 0.74u2) [David Haywood].
- Fixed bug in the time accounting for the V60 which was causing Outrunners to run with flickering sprites and slow music [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed another V60 bug introduced in 0.74u2 which broke the v70 games (and further broke Outrunners) [Kobat, Olivier Galibert].
- Fixed some bugs introduced with the timer system changes a while back [Aaron Giles]
- Fixes Exterminator and the Atari polygon games. Hopefully doesn't break anything in the process [David Haywood]:
  * Changed scanline timing to use floor() to get consistent results.
  * Fixed bug in time computation if requesting a scanline in the next frame.
  * Removed 4x executes per loop which screwed up timing.
  * Fixed internal interrupt generation to get consistent timing results.
  * Now uses the active callback as a base time when adjusting timers outside of a CPU context.
  * Fixed all the games again, but they are slower now due to more necessary interleaving.
- Fixed Dorachan Orientation [Tomasz Slanina].
- Various Fixes [Nathan Woods]:
  * Fixes a screenshot handling bug that affected Space Invaders.
  * Moves the MESS specific code into a separate module, reducing #ifdef clutter.
  * Moved some variable declarations out of for loops so that it can compile in non-GCC compilers.
  * Fixes REP CMPSW so that it uses words and not bytes.
  * Adds a call cpuintrf_set_dasm_override() that gives drivers	the ability to customize disassemblies. This probably isn't very useful	for MAME, but it is useful for MESS or things like software interrupts	used for BIOS calls.
  * Increases the size of the buffer used when logerror() output goes to OutputDebugString().
  * Moves config.c externs to a header file.
  * Adds another call, cli_rc_create(), which creates MAME's rc	struct for use elsewhere. (I'm actually creating a debug time consistency check feature for MAME32, to verify at runtime that the arguments that MAME32 has are consistent with MAME's).
  * When rc_destroy() is now called, freed pointers to strings and files will now be NULLed out.
- Overhauled the Canyon Bomber driver with a number of minor fixes like correct RAM size and VBLANK duration [Stefan Jokisch]:
  * hiscore reset button added.
  * Sprite positions should be fixed according to the schems.
  * Language ROM added (i.e. the language dip works now).
  * Prototype set renamed from canbprot to canyonp.
- Improved Super Chase sample loading [sedn].
- Replaced instances of "inline", "static inline", and "static __inline" with "INLINE".  This fixes some build problems with  xmame and makes things more consistent [Lawrence Gold].
- Corrected CPU speeds etc. in snowbros.c [Guru].
- Reversed inptport.c changes to 0.74u1 as the version in 0.74u2 wasn't correcly merged, these will need resubmitting.
- Some namcos22 Improvements [Phil Stroffolino]:
  The major things improved are:
  * Fixes to display list processing (affects Prop Cycle ending).
  * Gouraud shading.
  * Misc improvements for the not-working games.
