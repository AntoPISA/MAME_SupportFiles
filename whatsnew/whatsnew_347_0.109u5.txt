Source changes:
---------------
- Added new symbol 'curpc' for all CPUs which represents the value of the current instruction pointer, to avoid naming conflicts with the 'pc' register in other contexts. Changed this to be the default value for the disassembly window in the Windows version of the debugger (OSD ports will need to do likewise [Aaron Giles].
- Added save state support to the COP4xx core [Aaron Giles].
- Changed the new disassembler and override callback prototypes to take const parameters and to remove the generally unused 'bytes' parameter. The disassemblers can now assume that the buffers contain enough bytes to hold the maximum instruction length as returned by the CPU core get_info callback [Aaron Giles].
- Converted the following disassemblers to the new format, and added step in/out support where it was obvious: adsp21xx, alph8201, arm, arm7, asap, ccpu, cdp1802, cop4x0, dsp32c, e132xs, g65816, h6280, h83002, i8x41, i960, i8051, i8085, jaguar, m680x, m6805, m37710, mc68hc11, pic16c5x, rsp, s2650, se3208, sh2, sharc, t11, tms32010, tms32025, tms32031, tms34010, upd7810, v60, v810, z180, and z8000 [Aaron Giles].
- Deprecated the old disassembler interfaces in favor of the new ones [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed priorities and the offset of layer 3 in fcrash [robiza].
- Fixed subtle bug in subtable allocation in the memory system that caused the Eolith games to assert with the debugger [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed subtle bug in the UI menu handler that only manifested on mingw-based compiles [Nicola Salmoria].
- Improved behavior of SCSI CD implementation for audio playback and TOC reading commands [R. Belmont].
- Improved flash emulation and added support for Fujitsu flash chips. Switches Konami games over to new flash chips [smf].
- Tweaked the disassembly view to detect if the disassembly for the current instruction has changed, and if so, recompute the entire  view. This provides more dynamic updating when system states change under certain CPUs [Aaron Giles].
- Updated CHD locating behavior to accept CHDs referenced by the parent of a clone if the hash matches, even if it has a different name [smf].
