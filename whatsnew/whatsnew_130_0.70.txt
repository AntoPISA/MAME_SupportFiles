0.70 2003/06/10 [#130 - David Haywood]
--------------------------------------
This contains all the updates listed which were part of the source only diffs listed below (0.69a, 0.69b, 0.69u3) plus a few extra bits and pieces. A couple of drivers still appear to be broken with the new timer system (deadang, artmagic for example) but hopefully most of the problems were ironed out.
