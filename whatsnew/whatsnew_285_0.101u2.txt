Source changes:
---------------
- Added MMU support to the non-drc MIPS3 emulator. Converted the Killer Instinct, Seattle, Vegas, and Hyper Neo-Geo 64 drivers to a proper physical memory layout. Disabled the drc MIPS3 core until MMU support is added there as well [Aaron Giles].
- Added save state support to the S2650 CPU [Aaron Giles].
- Added support for logical mapping to the CPU interfaces and debugger. CPUs that have an MMU now need to support several new interface bits, including a logical address mask and page size for each address space, as well as a new translate function. There is also a new disassembler interface that should be used going forward, which will make it much simpler to keep the disassemblers standalone and not dependent on MAME functions for opcode accesses. Converted the i386 core to use the new interfaces [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned up i386 disassembler to produce Intel-standard output [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed a number of games that were broken due to the recent memory system changes. There are still more problems to fix; continue reporting them [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed time stamp counter in the Pentium core [Ville Linde].
- Fixed Z80 behavior on cold versus warm reset [Frank Palazzolo]. 
- Got rid of gross banking hack in the T11 core. Updated Atari System 2 drivers to accommodate the lack of the hack [Aaron Giles].
- Imported a number of memory handler conversion helpers from MESS, placed them in memconv.h [Aaron Giles].
