--------------------------------------
Sorry, this list of changes isn't complete due to hardware problems I'm having.


New games supported
-------------------
Hanagumi Taisen Columns - Sakura Wars  [Angelo Salese, David Haywood] (this the first st-v game to be supported by MAME, please note that due to the complexity of the system emulation is still preliminary and thereare still various issues that will need ironing out, there is currently no sound)
Sprint 8 [Stefan Jokisch]
Super Trivia Master [Pierpaolo Prazzoli] (wrong colours)
Twin Eagle 2 [Tomasz Slanina] (DOES NOT WORK due to protection involving the directions in which objects travel, and as a side-effect collisions don't work	correctly either, if somebody fixes this then itmight be fine apart from a few offset problems)
Ultra X Weapons [Tomasz Slanina] (some gfx offset problems / alignment (sprite handle can move?)

New Clones supported
--------------------
Lady Bug (bootleg on Galaxian Hardware) (input ports incomplete) [Mike Coates]
Video Pool (Moon Cresta hardware) (bootleg of Video Hustler) [Mike Coates] (dipswitches incomplete)
