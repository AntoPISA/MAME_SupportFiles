0.73 2003/09/04 [#143 - David Haywood]
--------------------------------------
Sorry, this list of changes isn't complete due to hardware problems I'm having.


New Games Supported
-------------------
Hanagumi Taisen Columns - Sakura Wars  [Angelo Salese, David Haywood] (1)
Sprint 8 [Stefan Jokisch]
Super Trivia Master [Pierpaolo Prazzoli] (2)
Twin Eagle 2 [Tomasz Slanina] (3)
Ultra X Weapons [Tomasz Slanina] (4)

New Clones Supported
--------------------
Lady Bug (bootleg on Galaxian Hardware) [Mike Coates] (5)
Video Pool (Moon Cresta hardware) (bootleg of Video Hustler) [Mike Coates] (6)

Notes:
------
(1): This the first ST-V game to be supported by MAME, please note that due to the complexity of the system emulation is still preliminary and thereare still various issues that will need ironing out, there is currently no sound.
(2): Wrong colours.
(3): DOES NOT WORK due to protection involving the directions in which objects travel, and as a side-effect collisions don't work correctly either, if somebody fixes this then itmight be fine apart from a few offset problems.
(4): Some GFX offset problems/alignment; sprite handle can move?
(5): Input ports incomplete.
(6): DIP switches incomplete.
