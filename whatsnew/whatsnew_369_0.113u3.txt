MAME Testers Bug Fixed (1):
---------------------------
- eprom0113u2gre (Zsolt Vasvari)


Source changes:
---------------
- Added proper MC8123 decryption code. Hooked up a number of games that were using the chip, making many of them playable [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed several SHARC opcodes where data transfer was done regardless of the condition. This fixes many things, like the upside-down geometry in Model 2B games. And also, probably all the remaining clipping issues in Gradius 4. At least the planet zooming out in the intro works now [Ville Linde].
- Added Z-clipping to the Model 2 driver [Ville Linde].
- Replaced old Sega System E driver with new one based on HazeMD [David Haywood].
- Fixed a large pile of DIP switches in the Sega System E games [Brian Troha].
- Fixed crashing bugs in SCSP emulation [David Haywood].
- ES5503 improvements [R. Belmont]:
  * Fixed extraneous click at end of samples;
  * Improved timing behavior. Fixes music tempo in many Apple IIgs apps and games in MESS.
- Fixed display of immediate word and long operands in the TMS340x0 disassembler [Philip Bennett].
- Updated Ultra Tank to component value code instead of a generic emulation and added 'Sprint 4' audio [Derrick Renaud].
- Added save state support to the gaelco3d driver. Also added save state support to tms32031.c and dmadac.c [Couriersud].
- Fixed analog controls in some vector games by adding back a faux VBLANK timing [Derrick Renaud].
- Changed the TMS340x0 core to clear the HSTCTLH NMI bit on an acknowledge [Philip Bennett].
- Externalized CDP1869 color bit handling to a callback function for MESS [Curt Coder].
- Refactored the options code into a new generic utility module options.c. Moved the MAME core options into a new module emuopts.c [Nathan Woods].
- Some minor NeoGeo set updates [Johnboy].
- Updates to the cybertnk driver [PS]:
  * Inter CPU communications;
  * Inputs (almost complete);
  * Sound;
  * Program ROMs marked as bad dumps;
  * Unmapped reads.
- Updated some more drivers updated to the new video timing [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Did a ground-up rewrite of the VIC Dual driver [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Added a preliminary MB86233 CPU core. Still needs to be hooked up to the Sega Model 2 driver [Ernesto Corvi].
- Fixed an interrupt delay slot problem in the SHARC core [Ville Linde].
- Improved K001005 polygon rendering [Ville Linde].
- Introduced a video_screen_exists() call, to determine whether a given screen exists. Updated the debugger to use this so as not to crash if no screens are present [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed glitches in neogeo driver introduced in last update [Aaron Giles].
- Added extensive (but still WIP) FD1094 debugging tools for help in brute force searching for keys [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug in voodoo emulation that caused improper framerates to be computed [Aaron Giles].
