[NOTE: only important changes are listed]


New Game Supported
------------------
(dkong)    Donkey Kong (US set 1) [Nicola Salmoria, Gary Shepherdson, Brad Thomas, Edward Massey]


Program changes:
----------------
- Donkey Kong support (wrong colors, no sound) [Nicola Salmoria, Gary Shepherdson, Brad Thomas, Edward Massey].
- Lady Bug and Crazy Climber should run a little faster on slow machines (Crazy Climber is still too slow, I know) [Nicola Salmoria].
- New definition of custom video modes, this will hopefully be compatible with more systems [Nicola Salmoria].

Source changes:
---------------
- New general purpose readinputport() function used to handle reads of input ports and dip switches. This saves some work when creating a game driver. Required changes to struct MachineDriver [Nicola Salmoria].
- Struct GfxLayout now contains a planeoffset array instead of planeincrement, to better support more than 2 bitplanes. I also fixed (I hope) all the code which assumed 2 bitplanes. struct GfxDecodeInfo had to be changed as well [Nicola Salmoria].
