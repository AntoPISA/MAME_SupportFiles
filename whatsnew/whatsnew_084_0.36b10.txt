These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------
- Fixed music in cworld2j [CAB].


Source changes:
--------------------
- Fixed controls in 'Ikari III' level 2 [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed 'Go Go Mr. Yamaguchi' [Takahiro Nogi].
- Fixed hangs in 'TNZS' [Quench].
- [DOS] Adjusted the autoframeskip code, to make it increase frameskip a little faster, but not as fast as it was before the previous change. Let's see how this performs [Nicola Salmoria].
- Support for gzipped (NOT zipped) cheat files. Uncompressed files still work [Mathis Rosenhauer].
- Merged the flags and orientation fields of struct GameDriver [Nicola Salmoria].
- Removed base and size from struct MemoryReadAddress, use MemoryWriteAddress to store the pointers. Several drivers had the bad habit of using MemoryReadAddress to initialize those variables, hopefully I haven't broken any while updating them [Nicola Salmoria].
- Removed prom_memory_region from struct GameDriver. The PROM memory region is now specified directly in the ROM declaration, with ROM_REGIONX( length, REGION_PROMS ). Similarly, REGION_GFX1..8 are defined for gfx decoding, but drivers have not been updated to use them. See drivers/namcos86.c for the only example [Nicola Salmoria].
- Removed samplenames from stuct GameDriver. It is now in struct SamplesInterface, and some drivers load the samples directly without using that structure. Due to this change, -listsamples and -verifysamples, and the samples information in -listinfo, are no longer available. Actually, samples might not be working at all - I haven't tested them [Nicola Salmoria].
