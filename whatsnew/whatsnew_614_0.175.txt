- sun4 updates: Preliminary implementation of sun4c MMU and related hardware [R. Belmont].
- gba.xml: Documented some more Game Boy Advance PCBs. [Fabio Priuli]
- gba.cpp: several improvements [Fabio Priuli]:
  * Implemented emulation of the "General Purpose I/O" port (GPIO) of GBA;
  * Hooked up S-3511 RTC emulation through the GPIO port. This allows to avoid the "Internal battery has run dry [...] clock-based events will no longer occur" messages in Pokémon Emerald / Ruby /!Sapphire. This also promotes Sennen Kazoku to working state;
  * Hooked up Boktai Light Sensor emulation through the GPIO port. This allows to avoid the "Solar Sensor is broken" message in Boktai / Bokura no Taiyou, which is now playable and to recharge your weapons in all three games of the series. Light level has to be chosen via the "Machine Configuration" menu, until we get some kind of camera input;
  * Hooked up Warioware Twist Gyroscope emulation through the GPIO port. This allows to play the minigames, even if in some case the input sensibility might need a few tweaks;
  * Hooked up Warioware Twist & Drill Dozer Rumble emulation through the GPIO port. MAME will now output a "Rumble" output bit (0 for Rumble=OFF and 1 for Rumble=ON) whenever the games try to access the Rumble component… third party applications can now listen to the output and redirect it to some hardware that can "rumble" in sync with the gameplay.
- gba.cpp: Implemented emulation of the Tilt sensor used by Yoshi’s Universal Gravitation / Yoshi Topsy-Turvy / Yoshi no Banyuuinryoku (and by Koro Koro Puzzle). Note that the calibration can seem a bit tricky at first, because the emulated screen does not turn as the GBA would... In order to properly calibrate the sensor, just keep pressed right for a few seconds when requested to calibrate right inclination (first calibration screen in Yoshi Universal Gravitation) so to get the full right range; then keep pressed for left for a few seconds when requested to calibrate left inclination (second calibration screen in Yoshi Universal Gravitation) so to get the full left range [Fabio Priuli].
- gb.cpp: Added Rumble emulation to the MBC-5 Game Boy Color games which supported it. MAME will now output a "Rumble" output bit (0 for Rumble=OFF and 1 for Rumble=ON) whenever the games try to access the Rumble component… third party applications can now listen to the output and redirect it to some hardware that can "rumble" in sync with the gameplay [Fabio Priuli].
- gb.cpp: Added partial RTC emulation to the MBC-3 Game Boy Color games which supported it. Clock proceeds a bit too fast during gameplay, but at least it is not stuck anymore to the time of first configuration [Fabio Priuli].
- Netlist changes [Couriersud]:
  * Introduced HINT(device, hint) to clarify that hints are inheritent and not specific to devices;
  * Added improved profiling support to netlist. Statistics output now proposes devices for which whole device activation/deactivation be disabled. No significant improvement for pong, but breakout experiences a 10% improvement;
  * Introduced perftime_t and perfcount_t for gathering statistics. These templates do not create any code if statistics are not kept;
  * Make help2man ./nltool produce usuable output;
  * Replaced shared_ptr by unique_ptr;
  * Better seperation of setup_t and netlist_t;
  * Fixed bugs in rdtsc code. Refactored timer code;
  * Moved options code from include to cpp file;
  * More truthtable refactoring. Removed half-finished code for internal state support. As implemented, this would have had no support for timing delays. 
  * All netlist device setup is now done in the device constructor. This significantly increases readability and stability and allowed to remove init_object calls and start calls;
  * Removed a significant amount of dead code;
  * Remove ATTR_HOT and ATTR_COLD. Refactored netlist_time;
  * More STL usage and c++11;
  * Get rid of nl_math. Remove nl_util.h and moved contents to plib/putil.h.
- Major refactoring of debugger core [Ryan Holtz]
  * Eliminate globals/file statics;
  * Remove lots of stuff from global scope;
  * Use std::function for custom command registration;
  * Eliminate some trampolines;
  * Build fixes from Vas Crabb and balr0g.
- n64.cpp: Disabled fast RAM, as it prevents watchpoints from working and doesn't gain much on the interpreter core [Ryan Holtz].
- rainbow.cpp: add 23-090b1 z80 arbitrator PROM dump [Lord Nightmare].
- Small update of italian traslation [AntoPISA].
- Fix keyboard shortcuts for disassembly comments pane [Vas Crabb]:
  * Win32 previously recognised Ctrl+N but menu incorrectly showed Ctrl+M;
  * Qt showed Ctrl+C but it was swallowed by text editing and didn't work;
  * Ctrl+N is now shown/used by Win32 and Qt (matches Cmd-N on OS X).
- Fix git version [Vas Crabb]:
  * Git version is set by top-level make, not just when GENie runs;
  * Can set IGNORE_GIT=1 for make to ignore git;
  * Git ignored/unavailable uses "unknown" in version string;
  * Mark modified trees as dirty;
  * Note that version now comes from makefile.
- A little change to device_image_interface::call_display to better decouple UI fronted and image devices [F. Ulivi].

- csdk80: Added correct monitor ROM [Nigel Barnes].
- imds2: Added monitor versions 1.1 and 1.2 [Nigel Barnes].
- terminal: Fixed Color configuration [Nigel Barnes].
- Memory fun [Olivier Galibert]:
  * Added AM_SELECT/addrselect field. Replaces the old AM_MIRROR/AM_MASK combo used to mirror a handler and get the mirrored bits in the offset;
  * Removed mask and/or mirror from where it didn't belong. Simplified a lot of instances of mask that just weren't needed, especially in bus handlers. Used the short forms of install handlers where possible;
  * Replaced the 60s hippy, "It's cool man" range parameter handling in map_range that tried to guess what was meant when the values passed were not entirely sensible, by a cranky, diner waitress-turned IRS auditor curmudgeon. Main control function has a series of 14 tests just to find a reason to fatalerror out your requests. You have been warned.

 * Add basic C-Sync callback to 315_5124.cpp, based on Charles' hw tests;
 * Add built-in Rapid Fire (uses C-Sync) for SMSJ and Korean SMS1 drivers;
 * Add new SMS drivers due to XTAL differences: sms1br - Tec Toy Master System I (Brazil) sms2br - Tec Toy Master System II (Brazil) smsbr - Tec Toy Master System III Compact (Brazil) sms1paln - Tec Toy Master System I (PAL-N) sms2paln - Tec Toy Master System II (PAL-N) smspaln - Tec Toy Master System III Compact (PAL-N) Brazil is PAL-M TV system, but I decided to call it by the country name, seems to be better recognizable and for emulation looks more like a NTSC system. PAL-N is used in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and looks closer to the European PAL system when compared to PAL-M.
- Load save state preparations [Nathan Woods]:
  * A number of changes and refactorings in preparation for a new load/save state menu. Most notably, I am C++-ifying osd_directory (now osd::directory) and changing osd_stat() to return std::unique_ptrosd::directory::entry;
