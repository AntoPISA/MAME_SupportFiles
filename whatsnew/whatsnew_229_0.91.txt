Eleven Beat [David Haywood] (2)
Magical Tetris Challenge [David Haywood]

Tarzan (IGS) [David Haywood] (4)

Notes:
------
(1): Both are missing proms - causes bad colours - and lack sound.
(2): These are n64 based, skeleton driver only with board layouts, maybe more useful to n64 emulator authors.
(3): Mostly ok, but sometimes pauses.
(4): No work been done on it, might be gambling.
