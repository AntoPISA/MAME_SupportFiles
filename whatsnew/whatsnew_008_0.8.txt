Program:
--------
- Added some support for Carnival - it boots and runs the demo, but the graphics are messed up.
- Fixed graphics in Moon Quasar (yes it does run, but you need the correct ROMs).
- Better error checking in the sound initialization routines. It still sucks, but at least will notify of problems instead of locking up the emulation. The "0. Silence" driver also works.
- Removed the "-nosound" command line switch, replaced it with "-soundcard n" which allows to bypass the audio driver selection menu. Use "-soundcard 0" to turn off sound.
- Some support for Space Invaders (+ some clones) but it doesn't work well.
- Support for Battle of Atlantis (a Scramble hack).
- The ROM copyright notice is displayed in the main emulation screen.
- Maybe I understood how the character colors are selected in Donkey Kong, at least in part, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I started fixing them. I based on the Kong emulator by Gary Shepherdson.
- Following changes provided by Mirko Buffoni: You can view the game graphics pressing F4. Use cursor keys to change graphics set/color, F4 to return to the game. Support for Mario Bros. (wrong colors, no sound) and Zaxxon (doesn't work yet).
- Better colors in Amidar and Frogger.


Source:
-------
- Added visible_area to the MachineDriver definition. It was used in all video drivers, so it's better to keep it centralized.
- Long-awaited function clearbitmap(), which correctly initializes a bitmap using background_pen. Note for people porting MAME to other systems:
  osd_create_bitmap() must call this function, the video drivers rely on that.
- I got rid of machine.c and put all into mame.c... when I have time, I'll try to organize the source better.
