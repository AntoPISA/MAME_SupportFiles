Program changes:
----------------
- Added some support for Carnival - it boots and runs the demo, but the graphics are messed up [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed graphics in 'Moon Quasar' (yes it does run, but you need the correct ROMs) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Better error checking in the sound initialization routines. It still sucks, but at least will notify of problems instead of locking up the emulation. The "0. Silence" driver also works [Nicola Salmoria].
- Removed the "-nosound" command line switch, replaced it with "-soundcard n" which allows to bypass the audio driver selection menu. Use "-soundcard 0" to turn off sound [Nicola Salmoria].
- Some support for 'Space Invaders' (+ some clones) but it doesn't work well [Nicola Salmoria].
- Support for 'Battle of Atlantis' (a Scramble hack) [Nicola Salmoria].
- The ROM copyright notice is displayed in the main emulation screen [Nicola Salmoria].
- Maybe I understood how the character colors are selected in Donkey Kong, at least in part, but I'm not sure. Anyway, I started fixing them. I based on the Kong emulator by Gary Shepherdson [Nicola Salmoria].
- You can view the game graphics pressing F4. Use cursor keys to change graphics set/color, F4 to return to the game. Support for Mario Bros. (wrong colors, no sound) and Zaxxon (doesn't work yet) [Mirko Buffoni].
- Better colors in 'Amidar' and 'Frogger' [Nicola Salmoria].


Source changes:
---------------
- Added visible_area to the MachineDriver definition. It was used in all video drivers, so it's better to keep it centralized [Nicola Salmoria].
- Long-awaited function clearbitmap(), which correctly initializes a bitmap using background_pen. Note for people porting MAME to other systems:

  osd_create_bitmap() must call this function, the video drivers rely on that.

- I got rid of machine.c and put all into mame.c... when I have time, I'll try to organize the source better [Nicola Salmoria].
