New games added or promoted from NOT_WORKING status
---------------------------------------------------
Devil Island (2 sets) [Brian Troha, The Dumping Union]

New clones added
----------------
Streaking (set 2) [Roberto Fresca]

New games marked as GAME_NOT_WORKING
------------------------------------
Magical Touch [Siftware, Mariusz Wojcieszek]


Source changes:
---------------
- Added explicit control handler for the console. Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break now explicitly terminate the process forcefully, rather than unwinding through the system in an unexpected state. Other console events (exit, shutdown, logoff) request a graceful exit [Aaron Giles].
- Added new devcb type DEVCB_TYPE_DRIVER, which implies the driver_device [Aaron Giles].
- Added new macros DEVCB_DRIVER_LINE_MEMBER and DEVCB_DRIVER_MEMBER to specify member functions of the driver device in callbacks [Aaron Giles].
- Added new method reset_origin() to screen devices to allow manual synchronization of VBLANK start against an external timing source. Updated the MC6845 device to call reset_origin() on its screen at the start of each frame if a screen is present [Aaron Giles].
- Attempt to provide a correct M50458 char rom, used by the Nintendo Super System [Pat Dardenko, Angelo Salese].
- Considerably improved UART communications in the CD-i 68070 implementation, increasing Quizard stability as a result [Harmony].
- Convert rendlay objects into C++, reduce the number of unused textures allocated [Aaron Giles].
- Converted the RCA CDP1802 CPU into a C++ device. Refactored cidelsa.c to use the new RCA COSMAC CPU [Curt Coder].
- Correctly free textures when screen size dynamically changes. Fixes texture assert when exiting on a number of games [Aaron Giles].
- Fix custom mapping for dsp56k internal memory [Aaron Giles].
- Fix texture leak in crsshair.c [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed use of the sign bits on the SegaCD Roz parameters, improves the SegaCD intro rotations etc. which now appear correct. Clamp Roz stuff to 24-bit, seems to fix the remaining issues with the Sega logos [David Haywood].
- More Clang fixes (verified OK with GCC) [Balrog].
- Moved -effect implementation out of OSD code and into core since the implementations were identical across Windows/SDL and implemented in the core itself [Aaron Giles].
- Refactored the CDP1869 chip into a C++ device [Curt Coder].
- Removed deprecat.h usage and did some minor clean-ups to the 4enraya driver [Angelo Salese].
- Removed deprecat.h usage from '1943' driver [Angelo Salese].
- Removed deprecat.h usage from 40love driver [Angelo Salese].
- Reworked '1942' interrupts by not using cpu_getiloops() function [Angelo Salese].
- Reworked NMK16 irqs by not using cpu_getiloops() function [Angelo Salese].
- Re-worked Quizard MCU communications handling to be more easily expanded [Harmony].
- Rewrote Alien Command irqs by not using cpu_getiloops() function [Angelo Salese].
