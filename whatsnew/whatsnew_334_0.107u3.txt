Source changes:
---------------
- 65816/377xx update [R. Belmont]:
  * Made block transfer instructions interruptable as they are on both actual chips (previously a single opcode could eat >400,000 cycles with obvious consequences for interrupt timing);
  * M377xx block transfers move one less byte than the 65816, fixed.
- Added beam width control to the UI sliders [Aaron Giles].
- Added new macro PORT_SERVICE_DIPLOC for specifying a PORT_SERVICE and a DIPLOCATION [Aaron Giles].
- Added new option -video none which can be used for CPU benchmarking without the overhead of the video system [Aaron Giles].
- Added options -screen, -aspect, -resolution, and -view which apply to all windows. These values can be individually overridden for each specific window by using the existing -screen<n>, -aspect<n>, -resolution<n>, and -view<n> options [Aaron Giles].
- Added several common generic graphics layouts to vidhrdw/generic.c, for use by multiple drivers [Aaron Giles].
- Added support for real "Bubble Bobble" MCU [Trinity, Nicola Salmoria].
- Adjusted the DAC sound level on the 2612 to something more reasonable [David Haywood].
- Began cleanup/rewrite of the Sega G-80 raster games. This is still very much a WIP, so don't report any bugs [Aaron Giles]:
  * Cleaned up input port handling similar to the G-80 vectors;
  * Proper clock and video speeds;
  * Reimplemented "Space Odyssey" background including collision detect;
  * Fully implemented "Pig Newton" background;
  * Connected 2-board "Monster Bash" more correctly.
- Fixed bug that caused the sound sampling code to not track changes in the refresh rate [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed remaining crashes in GDI/ddraw mode when drawing vector games [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed track lookup implementation in Virtua Racing, bringing the game much closer to playable [Olivier Galibert].
- Improved DIP switches in benberob [Brian Troha].
- Improved magicfly driver. All graphics are properly decoded / banked now [Roberto Fresca].
- Minor cleanup and speed hack removal in the konamigx.c [R. Belmont].
- More "Zaxxon" driver cleanups/fixes [Aaron Giles]:
  * Fixed sound problems in "Razmataz";
  * Corrected background and sprite positioning;
  * Fixed bugs introduced in sample handling;
  * Bootlegs and alternate versions work again;
  * Added state saving support to the Sega universal sound board.
- More improvements to the 6840 timer module. Updated the MPU4 driver to the most recent implementation. Convert Cosmic Chasm over to using the new system [El Condor].
- Properly documented and connected the MCU code in the Namco System 1, System 86, Baraduke, Pacland, and Sky Kid drivers [Brian Troha].
- Removed the -artwork option to avoid confusion. If you want to run without any artwork, use -view standard instead [Aaron Giles].
- Renamed "Native" views to "Pixel Aspect" views to avoid the confusion that they are anything but artificial aspect ratios [Aaron Giles].
- Taito JC update [Ville Linde]:
  * Some general improvements to the driver;
  * Added some more opcodes to the TMS320C51 core;
  * Improved the M2 driver so that the M2 kernel starts to boot, but it hangs quite soon due to some multiprocessor issues [Ville Linde].
- Updated several games' input ports to use IPT_BILL1 for bill acceptors [ClawGrip].
