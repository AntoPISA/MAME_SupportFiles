Source changes:
---------------
- Added some missing sounds to 'Wonder Stick' and 'Search Eye' [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added Tilemap0 color banking to esd16 [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Began adding support for SCRIPTS programs to the 53C810 emulation [Nathan Woods, R. Belmont].
- Changed the makefile so that debug objects are not compiled on non-debug builds [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed 6502 initialization so that all internal states are reset properly [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed a few more remaining issues from the 0.101u1 update [Aaron Giles, Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed bug in PSX GTE flag settings [Olivier Galibert].
- Fixed handling of the FR bit in the Status register on MIPS3. This fixes a few problems in CarnEvil, and probably affects a few other games as well. Also fixed bug where TLB exceptions were not filling in the Context and EntryHi registers correctly [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed implementation of mame_stricmp [William Krick].
- Fixed inputs in Passing Shot (Japan) [Ange Albertini, Barry Rodewald].
- Fixed music tempo in 'T.N.K.3'/'T.A.N.K' [R. Belmont, Kold666].
- Fixed save/restore of 8253 PIT. Also several updates to 'Top Gunner' [Mathis Rosenhauer]:
  * Removed shift register since it just seems to be needed to compensate for different DAC speeds.
  * Added 8254 PIT from PC emulation.
  * Added state saving.
- Fixed some bad tiles in naname [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed status flag from MCU in Taito SJ games, fixing the last digit of the score in Front Line [Nicola Salmoria].
- Implemented pixel-accurate dithering in the Voodoo emulation [Aaron Giles].
- Many fixes to the SHARC core and Konami PPC drivers [Ville Linde].
- Marked most gfx_layout and gfx_decode structures in the code as const [Aaron Giles].
- Removed ROMREGION_SOUNDONLY. Since -nosound no longer disables sound CPUs or sound cores (and hasn't for a while), failing to load sound ROMs was only leading to crashes [Aaron Giles].
- Renamed my_stricmp to mame_stricmp, converted all uses of stricmp in the code to call mame_stricmp, and #defined stricmp to something invalid to prevent code from using it in the future [Aaron Giles].
- Updated the discrete thump sound in 'Asteroids' to use component values instead of derived equations [Hans Andersson, Derrick Renaud].
