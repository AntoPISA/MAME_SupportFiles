-Heavily improved emulation of GRiD Compass 1101 (#6599) [usernameak]
 * Changes:
   - added known dump checksums of 1101 BIOS
   - high-level emulation of GPIB disk devices
   - partial implementation of DMA (currently ignores ACCRQ so devices must have zero latency in order for it to work)
   - serial is now properly memory-mapped
   - modem stub in order to make system properly ignore modem device
   - it now boots without any patches and debug scripts
   - merged #6597 (needed in order to make disk devices work)
   - Still not implemented:
   - RTC/MACHINE_ID
   - modem
   - has problems with multiple disk devices working simultaneously (possibly BIOS bug because this BIOS had some problems with that
      on real device)

-netlist: Fix a long standing bug in proxy/family code. (nw) [Couriersud]
 * This never materialized because proxies were always connected to GND in existing netlists. Now I ran into an example were it
    kicked in.

-netlist: Add simple ZDIODE model [Couriersud].
 * The model is driven by three additional model parameters: NBV, IBV, BV.
   - Example code how to define a typical 7.5V Zener diode:
     * ZDIODE(ZD, "D(BV=7.5 IBV=0.01 NBV=3)")
       - or

-naomigd: Eliminate get_read_ptr (nw) [AJR]

-t11: More accurate emulation of interrupt acknowledgment; add PF and HLT interrupts [AJR]
 * (nw) This is accurate behavior for the T11, but it makes some of the driver changes a bit more awkward than they probably should
    be, given that one device is standing in for every CPU vaguely related to the PDP-11 family. Galaxy Game obviously wasn't
    written for a T11, and the BK-0010's K1801VM1 doesn't look like a lot like the T11 either.

-CoCo: Changed driver coco3dw1 to have a default on becker port. [tim lindner]

-netlist: Adding prandom.h (nw) [Couriersud]

-netlist: Fix some tidy warnings. (nw) [Couriersud]

 * polepo/megapede: They should run on 16K / move to games section / add '/' to start
 * Signed-off-by: Andreas Mueller <schnitzeltony@gmail.com>

-netlist: Add two noise sources [Couriersud].
 * The two sources act as voltage sources, though noise may also be injected as conductivy or current noise.
   - SYS_NOISE_MT_U: Mersenne Twister uniform noise SYS_NOISE_MT_N: Mersenne Twister normal noise
     * nld_sys_noise is templated:
       - using NETLIB_NAME(sys_noise_mt_u) = NETLIB_NAME(sys_noise)<plib::mt19937_64, plib::uniform_distribution_t>;
         * Thus the approach is scalable. The implementation is state save aware, and thus reproducible results are guaranteed.
           - An example use case is provided as well, see examples/noise.cpp.

-netlist: simplify pfunction state handling. (nw) [Couriersud]
 * Removes dependency on pstate.h.

-hh_pic16: rename sfxchas to flash (nw) [hap]

-cischeat.cpp: fix scudhamm/armchmp2 irq and refresh rate to be measured 59.17 Hz instead of 30 [Angelo Salese]
 * Move armchmp2 specific I/Os into own state machine, and demoted it to MNW because the arm input not exactly understood and not
    supposed to require user input at POST anyway;

-cischeat.cpp: make it explicit that I know this is an anti-pattern (nw) [Angelo Salese]

-Fix OS X build (implicit inclusion differences between standard libraries strike again) (nw) [AJR]

-hh*: use full companyname for Ideal (nw) [hap]

-Refocus debugger on CPU when one of its watchpoints is hit. This solution may be less than ideal for some multiprocessing
 environments where CPUs share spaces, but it prevents the focus from shifting unpredictably to whichever CPU happens to be next in
 line to execute (e.g. when synchronization for a soundlatch write aborts the original CPU's timeslice) [AJR].

-i86, i286: Update m_prev_ip (and therefore CURPC) after taking interrupt (nw) [AJR]

-netlist: Restructered the save state system. (nw) [Couriersud]
 * This change makes state saving contract based. Objects which need to save state need to have the following template member:
   - template <typename ST> void save_state(ST &st) { /* Example */ st.save_item(m_p,   "m_p"); st.save_item(m_buf, "m_buf"); }
     * This member function is called when the object is passed to the state manager save function.

 * First one corrupted wav files produced on windows. The second one produced wrong sample integration results.

-netlist: fix validate. (nw) [Couriersud]

-netlist: nlwav - new functionality [Couriersud].
 * nlwav now supports 16 and 32 bit integer format (wav16s, wav32s) as well as 32 bit float format (wav32f). The "wav" format is no
    longer supported. Added support for high and low pass filtering the wav output. Dynamic volume adjustment (use "-a 0")
   - -hpboost can suppress spikes at the beginning of the file (<10ms)
   - The addition of the float format simplifies debugging significantly since it covers the whole dynamic format.
   - Added nlwav to the local VS 2019 build.

-raiden2.cpp: add U0342 PAL to ROM definitions [neSneSgB]
 * https://twitter.com/neSneSgB/status/1232115385303879680 Discussion starting here, I successfully dumped a .jed from a location
    test US Raiden 2, and confirmed that the dump worked on a final Raiden 2 PCB. The .jed is downloadable from that thread, and I
    converted it to a binary using jedutil to generate the CRC and SHA1.

    (Komplement).mfm' contains invalid characters

-z80scc: don't invent data (nw) [Patrick Mackinlay]

-Fixed regression in peps0615 introduced in 635f469c7dd0b5166455bafeddb0e898b1081165, the game writes to the page buffer then sends
 a spurious start condition before the stop condition that writes the buffer [smf].
 * Created i2cmem sub classes for all used device types, fixed the buffer sizes that were wrong, removed the methods for modifying
    the data & buffer sizes and changed the drivers to use the correct types [smf].
   - Switched aa310 & ertictac over to use device/machine/pcf8583.cpp, which is not currently based on i2cmem.cpp but might be worth
      merging in the future [smf].

-Debugger - add `-debuglog` option to log debug console output to file [Stephen Oberholtzer]
 * When this option is specified, all console output is echoed to a log file.
   - Some caveats/limitations:
     * The file-open process was copied from -log, so it has the same limits
     * Filename is hard-coded (debug.log)
     * File is overwritten if it exists
     * File is opened during emulation initialization
     * Thus, the file is cleared if you invoke the "Hard Reset" debugger command
     * Probably some other details I don't know about
     * Logging works as such: When a string is appended to the scrollback buffer, it is also written to the log file.
     * Some commands forcibly wrap their output (e.g. `help` to 80 columns.) Because this wrapping is done inside the scrollback
        buffer, the text written to the file is not wrapped.
     * This can be seen with `help execution`.

 * working macro level parameters
 * simplified code significantly
 * fixed a number of hidden issue
 * dead code removal
 * It is now possible to define netlist level parameters using:
 * static NETLIST_START(chip) DEFPARAM(parameter, 123) RES(R1, $(@.parameter)) .... NETLIST_END()
 * NETLIST_START(main)
 * chip(X1) PARAM(X1.parameter, 1000) ... NETLIST_END()
 * This will pass on 1000 to R1 as a parameter.
 * "@." will resolve to the current namespace. In this case it is X1, thus "X1.parameter. This is during parsing. During evalution,
    i.e. device creation, $(X1.parameter) is evaluated to 1000.
 * This also means, that global parameters are possible and accessible ...
 * DEFPARAM(P, 234) ... RES(R1, $(P))
 * or going forward
 * RES(R1, 1000) CAP(C1, 1.0 / $(R1.R))
 * This opens up the path to more possibilities ...
 * static NETLIST_START(DM9456_DIP) DEFPARAM(MODEL, "74XX") DM9456_GATE(X1) DM9456_GATE(X2) PARAM(X1.MODEL, $(@.MODEL))
    PARAM(X2.MODEL, $(@.MODEL)) ... NETLIST_END()
 * NETLIST_START(main)
 * DM9456_DIP(X1) PARAM(X1.MODEL, "LS74XX") ... NETLIST_END()
 * The code also has been prepared to allow something along the lines of
 * LIBENTRY_MODEL(DM74LS00_DIP, DM7400_DIP, "LS74XX")
 * to define a LS version on top of an DM7400_DIP bare TTL implementation. This however will need more efforts to existing devices
    to honour some timing adjustment in the model definition. It will already honour different output specifications between LS
    series and bare TTL if connected to analog components.

-netlist: rewrite ROM devices from scratch [Couriersud].
 * Thanks to Aaron Giles who made me think about a different approach.
   - This is a rewrite from scratch for ROM devices. It uses a generic template to implement ROM devices which is used together with
      a description struct to define a ROM device. This leads to highly efficient code since all information is available at compile
      time.
     * This is also a step forward to support tristate outputs. All ROM devices covered by this approach have tristate or open
        collector outputs and thus all code changes to support tristate outputs can now be made consistently in one file.

 * These tristate buffers natively support tristate outputs. For use cases with fixed enable inputs the devices support a parameter
    FORCE_TRISTATE_LOGIC which if being set to 1 makes the device behave like a logic output.
   - Added additional syntax and consistency checks for tristate outputs. Updated the example and added dip implementations

-emumem: Slight speedup [O. Galibert]

-emumem: Another slight speedup, implemented on the 680x0 for now [O. Galibert]
 * memory_access_specific is declared and used exactly like memory_access_cache, but does not cache.  It does, however, shortcut the
    virtual call into address_space, so that's one layer of call less. Gives another nice speedup for accesses with bad locality
    (e.g. anything that's not opcodes), at the expense of having a specifically typed object in the class.  Should do well for cpus
    in general, drivers can keep using the address_space access calls for easier logistics.

    pins
 * Fixed the output of a GAL16V8 device in Simple Mode to mark relevant output pins as providing feedback as documented in the
    datasheet.

-emumem: A little more speedup.  cache and specific change syntax, and are not pointers anymore [O. Galibert]
 * The last(?) two changes are:
   - Add a template parameter to everything (theoretically the address space width, in practice a level derived from it to keep as
      much compatibility between widths as possible) so that the shift size becomes a constant.
   - Change the syntax of declaring and initializing the caches and specifics so that they're embedded in the owner device.  Solves
      lifetime issues and also removes one indirection (looking up the base dispatch pointer through the cache/specific pointer).

-unsp20 - fix opcode decode priority, we causing an ASR operation to be decoded as a MUL [David Haywood] (#6740) [David Haywood]

-Debugger expression and memory access overhaul [AJR]
 * Memory references in expressions no longer default to the console's visible CPU if no device name was specified, except when
    entered through the console itself. Expressions in view windows now use the context of the currently selected device instead.
 * The pcatmem debug command and similar qt mouseover function now produce an error message if the initial address translation
    fails.
 * Related internal changes (nw)
 * The debugger_cpu class no longer interprets memory accesses. The existing routines have been moved into symbol_table (which used
    to invoke them as callbacks), and reimplemented in most other places. Thecode duplication is a bit messy, but could be
    potentially improved in the future with new utility classes.
 * The cheat engine no longer needs to hook into the debugger_cpu class or instantiate a dummy instance of it.
 * The inclusion of debug/express.h within emu.h has been undone. Some debugging structures now need unique_ptr to wrap the
    resulting incomplete classes; hopefully the performance impact of this is negligible. Another direct consequence is that the
    breakpoint, watchpoint and registerpoint classes are no longer inside device_debug and have their own source file.
 * The breakpoint list is now a std::multimap, using the addresses as keys to hopefully expedite lookup.
 * The visible CPU pointer has been removed from the debugger_cpu class, being now considered a property of the console instead.
 * Many minor bits of code have been simplified.

-mw8080bw: 280zzzap netlist audio (#6760) [Colin Douglas Howell]
 * mw8080bw: update 280zzzap audio API in preparation for netlist audio
 * This is only API changes, following the pattern used by cuavas within the past year to update other games in mw8080bw.
 * mw8080bw: new netlist audio implementation for 280zzzap
 * New netlist-based audio implementation for 280zzzap (280-ZZZAP, 1976), derived from Midway game logic board schematic. The sound
    generally matches that heard in videos of the machine, though the real machine seems to have more bass and less treble. This may
    be a cabinet effect or something else, such as a difference in component values.
 * Due to the number of complex components being emulated and the nature of the circuits, this netlist adds a lot of overhead, but
    it's still fast enough to run at greater than real speed on modern hardware.
 * With minor changes, this implementation should also support lagunar (Laguna Racer, 1977); with somewhat more substantial changes,
    it would also support sspeedr (Super Speed Race, 1979). Both of these games use sound circuits based on those for 280-ZZZAP.

     * In addition the following refactoring and code maintenance work is included. Please excuse the large commit, some of this
        took interfered with other work and the detail development steps were ugly.

          described in the c++ core guidelines.
       - clang-tidy fixes
       - A significant refactoring of palloc.h. Aligned hints were removed, they added complexity without a significant performance
          gain. Vector operations should better be done on special spans/views.
       - The code has been tested on linux with g++-7, g++-9, clang-11. On Windows mingw-10 and VS2019, OSX clang-11.
