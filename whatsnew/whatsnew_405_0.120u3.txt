Source changes:
---------------
- Cleaned up the inline assembly for both x86 and PPC, enabled the mul32 family assembly stuff on 32-bit x86, and fixed some compiler warnings on 64-bit GCC. In addition [Vas Crabb]:
  * Provided single-precision reciprocal approximation code for PowerPC and x86 with SSE2.
  * Filled in all other TBD functions in eigccx86.h for completeness.
  * Conditionalised some code in eigccppc.h so that it isn't used when the compiler has 64-bit instructions available.
- Added static qualifiers and renamed symbols in MAME in an effort to further tidy up the global namespace. Generally generic names were targeted and some symbols that were both static and extern. Some specifics [Atari Ace]:
  * K053247_ram was made static throughout and the existing K053247_export_config was used to obtain the value in xmen.c.
  * The enums DS1991_STATE and DSP_TYPE were unused and were therefore removed. 
  * Dead code in cps3.c and thayers.c was discovered and commented out.
- Made almost all input port definitions static [Aaron Giles].
- Obsoleted the GAMEB macro, which is no longer necessary [Atari Ace].
- Fixed casting issues in new inline validity checks [R. Belmont].
- Some build-related improvements to the sound cores [Atari Ace]:
  * The SCSP dependency on mame/drivers/stv.c was removed allowing it to built independent of the driver.
  * The WAVE dependency on MESS code was made explicit, so it can be built independentally of MESS. 
  * VOTRAX can now be built independentally of SAMPLES.
  * The YM2612 core now can be built without including the YM3438 core.
  * Unnecessary uses of BUILD_ and HAS_ macros have been removed.
  * BUILD_ instead of HAS_ macros are used in 3812intf.c for consistency with the other fm cores.
- Added DIP locations to several SSV games (in ssv.c) [Vas Crabb].
- Corrected some errors in the SH4 core and implemented store queues and the basics of DMA. Added a call to simulate dma transfers with external devices [Samuele Zannoli].
- Expanded polynew.c to support quad rendering. Converted midvunit.c over to using the new quad rendering, which fixes a number of rendering issues that have plagued the driver since the start [Aaron Giles].
- Added Z-clipping logic to polynew.c. Converted namcos22 over to using that code. Simplified namcos22 significantly, working in quads throughout the lower-level pipeline and then handing the results off to polynew.c [Aaron Giles].
- Updated model3.c to use the new poly code, and changed much of the low-level implementation to make things easier [Aaron Giles].
- Defined a couple of new functions in eminline.h: atomic_increment32 and atomic_decrement32 [Aaron Giles].
