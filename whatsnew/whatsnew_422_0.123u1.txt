- Corrected the clocks on the following pcbs: Formation Z, MagMax, SlapFight and Tiger Heli. Changed Oki m6295 pin 7 to "high" on Toki and Blood Bros [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Improve build independence for CPU/sound cores. Rescued the M65CE02 core from bitrot hell, and fixed some MESS cores that were broken by the deprecat.h changes [Atari Ace].
- Corrected the initial detection of extended INP files [Barry Rodewald].
- Moved Galaxy Games emulation to tmaster.c [Luca Elia].
- makefile/build updates [Couriersud, Aaron Giles]:

- Fixed DIP switches and inputs for all games in cvs.c [stephh].
- Added HOTD2-specific BIOSes [Arzeno Fabrice].
