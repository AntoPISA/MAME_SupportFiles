Source changes:
---------------
- Added macros to prevent use of strcasecmp and strncasecmp for better cross-platform compatibility [Nathan Woods].
- Added MDRV_SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS() which lets you specify a pixel clock, horizontal, and vertical video timing values in place of the usual screen size, visible area, refresh rate, and VBLANK timing values [Aaron Giles].
- Added service_coin_lockout_w() to lockout service coins [Aaron Giles].
- Changed mode selection logic so that refresh is weighted more strongly when picking a mode. This allows you to specify -resolution 0x0@60 to force MAME to pick a 60Hz screen refresh while allowing it to choose the best resolution [Aaron Giles].
- Connected unimplemented opcode $01 on the 6809 core [Antoine Mine].
- Fixed bug in 8039 CPU handling of A11 latch [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug that prevented save/restore from working in the UI [Aaron Giles].
- Implemented CNT pin and some serial features of the 6526 CIA chip [Nathan Woods].
- Mapped service button in slammast [Canim].
- Massive cleanup/fixing of 16-bit Sega drivers [AWJ]:
  * Many corrections to descriptive set names, adding revision letters, cabinet types, etc.
  * Fixed many DIP switches and added PORT_DIPLOCATION support.
  * Adjusted min/max values for analog controls to improve response.
  * Fixed button ordering between System 16A/B.
  * Cleaned up a number of ROM names and fixed some incorrect guesses.
  * Some cleanup of turbo.c as well.
  * Fixed visible area in 'Hang-On' hardware.
  * Actually disabling 8751 in games that have a fake replacement.
  * Hooked up 8255 PPI correctly now that it has mode 2 support.
  * Fixed behavior of NMI line in later sega sound boards.
  * Fixed addressing in the SegaPCM sound system.
  * Some hardware/documentation cleanup.
- Rewrote 'Zaxxon' driver from the schematics. This is still a WIP (not finished yet) [Aaron Giles]:
  * Correct clock speeds and video timing.
  * Complete memory maps.
  * Connected universal sound board to 'Ixion' and 'Razmataz'.
  * Simplified video code and merged common cases together.
  * Palette derived from resistor weights.
  * Background positioning still a little off.
- Some cleanups in the new UI/video code to make MESS happy [Nathan Woods].
