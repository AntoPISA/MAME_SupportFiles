MAME Testers Bug Fixed (1):
--------------------------
- galpanic0100u4yel (Pierpaolo Prazzoli)


Source changes:
---------------
- Added save state information for streams so that dynamic volume changes get properly restored. Unfortunately this breaks all existing save states [Aaron Giles].
- Added save state support to the classic Williams drivers, marking them as GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE [Aaron Giles].
- Added save state support to the HC55516 sound chip. Added save state support to the Williams sound boards. Added save state support to games in the mcr3.c and mcr68.c drivers, marking them as GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE [Aaron Giles].
- Balanced the sound in Final Tetris, Boogie Wings, B.C. Story, Metal Saver [sonikos].
- Changed timer_alloc_ptr-style timers so that the pointer parameter is supplied at allocation time and is not changeable. This makes these timers more easily supported in save states [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned up and fully mapped the Williams sound boards. Also added save state support to them [Aaron Giles].
- Corrected CPS1 frequencies based on measurements from a real PCB [Philip Bennett].
- Deferred state loading until all anonymous timers have cleared. This fixes issues where the timers would fire after the load and would clobber data that was just loaded [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed missing save state registrations in the m6809 CPU core [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed Q*Bert knocker connection [Kevin Jonas].
- Integrated 53C810 into the SCSI framework [Tomas Karlsson].
- Significant change to the memory system. RAM areas are now no longer allocated out of the memory_region for a given CPU. This means that drivers which assume that RAM is located at some offset to the base of the memory region will be broken [Aaron Giles].
- Some improvements to M37710, C352 and NamcoNA sound [cync].
