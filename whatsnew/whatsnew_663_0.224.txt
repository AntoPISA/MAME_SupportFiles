Cherry Master I (ver.1.01, set 9) [Team Europe]

-Cherry Master I (ver.1.01, set 9) improvements [Roberto Fresca, Team Europe] [Roberto Fresca]:
 * Redumped the NMC27CP128Q devices as 27C256 and found complete/perfect binaries.
 * Descrambled the program.
 * This is weird... The National NMC27CP128Q datasheet says that these devices are 16k x8 (0x4000). Also the diagram lacks of A14
    line. Surprisingly they can hold 32k x8 (0x8000) binaries. We're thinking if the ones present in the board are fake.

-mdos dsk: support legacy floppy images, add XDOS support [68bit]
 * Add legacy floppy image support which is currently required for the mc6843 FDC emulator and used by the EXORset which run XDOS a
    variant of MDOS.
 * Add support for 5.25 inch XDOS floppy drive formats as used by the EXORset.
 * Make some of the identity tests more permissive to work with observer disks. The date day and month are reversed on some disks,
    and the boot rib cluster is lower.

-mc6843: add a delay reading the CRC [68bit]
 * Code using programmed I/O may read the last byte of a sector and then expect to have some time to store that to memory before
    receiving an interrupt on the completion of the command. The interrupt was occurring on the last read and the last byte was
    being lost by some drivers. This change adds a delay after reading the last byte, roughly the time needed to read the 16 bit
    CRC, before the end of a read command is processed.
 * Avoid side effects when these are disabled.
