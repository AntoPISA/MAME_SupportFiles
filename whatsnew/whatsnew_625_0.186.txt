  * Moved static data (short name, full name, source file) out of devices and into device types;
  * Moved state class out of MACHINE_CONFIG_START, eliminating need for MACHINE_CONFIG_FRAGMENT and MACHINE_CONFIG_DERIVED_CLASS;
  * Made game drivers add machine configuration in the same way as any other device;
  * Added support for machine configuration in device members, allowing many internal handlers to be made protected or private;
  * Moved many constants used internally by devices out of headers and into source files;
  * Converted many constants to scoped enums, and reduced scope of many constants and types;
  * Made many callback setters forward the parameter;
  * Cleaned up many names that are reserved because they begin with _[A-Z] or contain two consecutive underscores;
  * Gave many devices more descriptive names, and renamed some device types and classes with overly generic names;
  * Untangled fantasy sound and Microprose 3D noise from the driver state classes;
  * Converted DECO BSMT2000 ready callback from a function pointer to a device delegate;
  * Made many devices use object finders for subdevices rather than doing tagmap lookups later;
  * Started to disentangle TI-99 from TI-990 and organised stuff by bus type;
  * Made some TI-99 buses use slot/card interfaces properly;
  * Turned some of the FM, SID, SCSP DSP, EPIC12 and Voodoo cores into idiomatic C++;
  * Factored out some boilerplate for YM chips with PSG;
  * Made Z180 table allocation/setup a bit safer;
  * Improved encapsulation of Z80DART channels and SNES PPU;
  * Converted generic keyboard and terminal to use a device delegate rather than WRITE8 since space/offset/mask aren't relevant;
  * Made terminal device dynamically allocate buffer so derived devices (e.g. teleprinter) can specify size;
  * Started to break out common parts of Samsung ARM SoC devices;
  * Consolidated and de-duplicated forward declarations in src/emu, and removed some obsolete ones;
  * Added #include guards to many headers that were missing them, and made many existing ones consistent;
  * Removed rarely used output and PTY interfaces from emu.h prefix header.
- Improvements to auxiliary verbs [Vas Crabb]:
  * Added support for device sets to -listroms (e.g. mpu401 or m68705p3);
  * Added support for multiple names/patterns to -listroms, -verifyroms and -listxml;
  * Added check that device short names don't exceed 32 characters in -validate;
  * Made -listxml instantiate slot devices as children of slots rather than the root device;
  * Improved performance of device type walk by at least two thirds.
