Source changes:
---------------
- Added a red background to serious warning messages in the vain hope that people might take better notice [Aaron Giles].
- Added new function configure_screen() which can control the width, height, visible area, and refresh rate of each screen. This function allows for widths and heights larger than what were specified in the game driver, so you no longer have to specify the maximum width and height in the driver, but can instead specify a typical width and height. This function supercedes the old set_visible_area() and set_refresh_rate() functions. The former has been rewritten to call configure_screen(), while the latter has been removed entirely [Aaron Giles].
- Added some PPC602 specific opcodes and registers [Ville Linde].
- Added what seems to be a proper fix for the background transparency flag that was needed by champbwl to show the green background [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Changed the behavior for supporting overscan and other effects. The width and height of a screen control the overall bitmap size. The visible area of a screen specify its non-blanked boundaries (and default visible area, as before) [Aaron Giles].
- Consolidated live screen parameters into a screen_state structure. Machine->visible_area[num] is now Machine->screen[num].visarea. Machine->refresh_rate[num] is now Machine->screen[num].refresh [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed memory write ordering bug in the 68000 core [Charles MacDonald].
- Fixed vector game crashes with DirectDraw rendering [Aaron Giles].
- Massively rewrote the user interface to rely on the new rendering systems. Broke the UI into multiple pieces (ui.c, uimenu.c, uigfx.c). The code is now verging on readable [Aaron Giles].
- Moved line-to-quad conversion routine into the core render.c as another utility function [Aaron Giles].
- Removed hard core dependency on samples [Andrew Gardner].
- Removed NEW_RENDER definition and all support for the old rendering system from the core. Cleaned up a bunch of useless and deprecated code as a result [Aaron Giles].
- Renamed ui_popup to popmessage across the code, and implemented popmessage in mame.c. This breaks the dependency between the core driver code and the user interface in almost all cases [Aaron Giles].
- Updates to the MagicFly driver [Robert Fresca]:
  * Figured out the MC6845 (mapped at $0800-$0801);
  * Fixed the screen size based on MC6845 registers;
  * Fixed the visible area based on MC6845 registers;
  * Corrected the gfx ROM region;
  * Solved the NMI/vblank issue. Now attract works;
  * Changed CPU clock to 625khz;
  * Added new findings to the technical notes;
  * Marked magicfly PAL as NO_DUMP (read protected).
