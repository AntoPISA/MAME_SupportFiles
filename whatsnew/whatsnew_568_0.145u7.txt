Source changes:
---------------
- m68k improvements [Hans Ostermeyer]:
  * Fixed BFINS, BFEXTU, and BFEXTS to fetch 8-bit quantities as 8 bits (corrects Domain/OS 10.3.5 crash on page boundry);
  * Added SoftFloat log functions and m68k FLOGNP1, FLOGN, FLOG2, and FLOG10 instructions.
- kinstb, ffight2b, iron, denseib, sblast2b (snesb.c): Fixed DIP Switches and Coin Inputs (after verification of the 5A22 code) [stephh].
- PGM, Scorpion 4/5 and Astra Fruit Machine [David Haywood]:
  * Slightly reworked some previous PGM submissions;
  * Reorganized many bfm_sc4/sc5 sound ROMs;
  * Added some notes, code and alternate revisions to astrafr.c.
- nbmj8891.c: Fixed font graphics in hanamomo [Takahiro Nogi].
- uPD1990AC: Only latch CSx bits when STB is high [R. Belmont].
- proconn.c: Added the basic device definitions for this driver with some NULL callbacks for now, setting the framework for more progress later [David Haywood].
- globalfr.c: VFD improvement to allow for better debugging as well as some ROM splitting of clones for the driver. Also did some stepper motor work to support more types [James Wallace].
- ecoinf3.c: Added some 8255s (maybe too many, not sure how many the PCBs have) and identified where it writes the 'VFD' strings [David Haywood].
- silvmil.c: Added known DIP switches & locations. Derived clock speeds from actual OSCs located on the PCB [Brian Troha].
- Revamped the sprite decryption of raiden2-like Seibu boards [Andreas Naive]:
  * Added support for Zero Team.
  * Code refactored to clarify the algorithm.
- Improvements to Jaleco's "Stepping Stage Special" [Luca Elia]:
  * Fixed memory maps, ROM loading, added inputs;
  * Hooked up sprites, hacked in the text layer;
  * Can be made to boot using the debugger.
- icecold.c update [Sandro Ronco]:
  * This game has mechanical parts so it's not exactly playable, but it is possible try it until the end giving the expected inputs;
  * Imported the i8279 device from MESS and updated to support sensor mode and mask nibble;
  * Made a simple layout and the defined input ports.
- Improved the serial emulation in 68307 and added some logging, removing the hack in bfm_sc4.c [David Haywood].
- Meyco driver improvements [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Reworked Inputs for all games;
  * Added button-lamps support;
  * Created internal control layout for all games;
  * Added mech counters support;
  * Promoted all games to working state;
  * Renamed the mdrawpkra ROMs based on PCB picture;
  * Renamed the driver to meyc8080.c;
  * Added technical and game notes.
- Preliminary Imagetek I5000 sound emulation [hap].
- Started giving Scorpion games their own reel / key configs, which is needed for most of them to pass their post / not hang on 'reel errors' or infinitely spinning reels.  Also more work on 68307's [David Haywood].
- Converted turbo.c to use i8279 device [Sandro Ronco].
- Added some better command handling to stop SC4 games from overwriting their attract mode messages with garbage [James Wallace].
- Preliminary work on Scorpion 4 lamps + more set resorting [David Haywood].
- Discovered similarities in gotcha.c to Data East Bootleg sprites, also happening to be the closest implementation to Silver Millennium in the sources. Refactored each based on this information [David Haywood].
- Refactored a few things related to reels and use of layouts allowing for more function with less work  [David Haywood].
- CPS-3 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Fixed CD Catalog # for jojoba 990927 and properly renamed the CHD;
  * Realigned the games table.
- amaticmg.c: Figured out encryption [Andreas Naive].
- paradise.c: Corrected Difficulty DSW for Penky and added notes about alternate DSW settings as found in scanned Pins & Dip manual [Brian Troha].
- gumbo.c: Added DIP switch locations to all sets in the driver [Brian Troha].
- sliver.c: Filled in / Corrected all DIP switches for Sliver and added DIP switch locations [Brian Troha].
- sangho.c: Filled in some DIP switches for 'Sexy Boom' and 'Puzzle Star' and added DIP Switch locations [Brian Troha].
- pokechmp.c: Correct DIP switches as per manual and add DIP switch locations [Brian Troha].
- sangho.c: Sexy Boom's difficulty DSW setting corrected and verified [stephh].
