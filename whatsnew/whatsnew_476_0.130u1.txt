--------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE: The CHD format has undergone a change with this release.The main reason for this change is to include some of the key metadata into the hashes for the CHDs. This ensures that the metadata is valid and prevents abuse. The first impact you will find is that all of your CHD differencing files are invalid. Just delete your "diff" directory contents entirely. The second impact is that all your existing CHDs will warn you that they have incorrect hashes. This is expected. Your old CHDs should still work fine, so if you can live with the "bad ROM" warnings, you don't really need to do anything. However, if this bugs you or you want to be "clean", you can update your CHDs, using this command line:

chdman -update <chdfile> <newchdfile>
   
for each one of your CHDs. This will take a while, but will produce CHDs that match the new checksums posted in the drivers.

Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed C140 ROM loading in winrun, winrun91 and driveyes [Phil Bennett].
- Added Champion Italian PK blue board and promoted Champion Italian PK green board (previously citalian) and Champion Italian Cup (previously citaliana) to GAME_WORKING status [Mirko Buffoni, David Haywood].
 - Added cpokerpk (also known as CPK blue board for the color of the board):
  * Renamed (citalian) to (cpokerpkg) (green board, can be seen in ROM too);
  * Renamed (citaliana) to (citalcup);
  * Added PAL decryption, making all games playable;
  * Updated input ports and fixed GFX layout to use 6 bitplanes like all others;
  * Changed number10 and cpokerpk video udpate to not use transparency.
- Updated CHD format to version 4. Checksums are now computed and stored separately for raw data and metadata, and metadata is now checksummed by default [Aaron Giles].
- Updated chdman to support a generic metadata addition system:
  chdman -addmetatext <chdfile> <tag> [<index>] <sourcefile>
  chdman -addmetabin <chdfile> <tag> [<index>] <sourcefile> [Aaron Giles].
- Changed the CHD verify interfaces to pass back a structure containing all the necessary data for verification and fixing [Aaron Giles].
- NeoGeo update [Johnboy]:
  * maglordh: Renamed p1 to correct chip label (MichaelNet);
  * Renamed (maglordh) to (maglord) (MVS) and (maglord) to (maglordh) (AES);
  * whp: Renamed several ROMs to correct chip label (MichaelNet);
  * kof2001: Renamed p's to correct chip label; added note (MichaelNet);

  * eightman: Removed BAD_DUMP from m1, is correct (Guru/Smitdogg).
- Merged Casino Winner and Royal Casino drivers [Angelo Salese]:
  * Fixes Royal Casino colors;
  * Added flip screen support to the driver;
  * Changed Casino Winner to be a clone of Royal Casino;
  * Cleaned-up the driver.
- Fixed Midnight Landing GFX bitplanes [Angelo Salese].
- PGM updates [Xing Xing, David Haywood]:
  * Added kov2p205, martmasc romset;
  * Fixed some descriptions;
  * Experimental video change with a view to fix priorities on kov2.
- Modified cdrom.c to expose metadata read/write functions, and changed chdman to use them. Also changed chdman to parse old-style metadata and convert it to new-style metadata [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed regressed sound in the deco MLC driver [Angelo Salese].
- Preliminary protection simulation in olds100a [XingXing].
- Added an older Japanese neogeo BIOS [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Improvements to 'Counter Steer' [Angelo Salese].
- Added new function core_fload() to load a file into an allocated buffer. Updated src2html, regrep, and chdman tools to use this function where appropriate [Aaron Giles].
- Fix f1gpstr2 sound regression [Phil Bennett].
- Added default nvrams to sfbonus.c using rom_load_optional. This should save some time renaming and reparenting these in the future [David Haywood].
- Minor video/psx.c changes that were needed for raycrisis [David Haywood].
- Fixed 'Heavy Unit' main CPU bankswitch. This fixes the enemy appearing in attract mode [Mamesick].
- Added text tilemap flickering to pzletime. It allows to see the selected options [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Changed the CPU cores to use the get_safe_token() pattern like other devices [Aaron Giles].
- System16 update: Enabled some buttons previously marked as 'unused'. Manuals say 'No Connection', but programs read them and do something. i.e. button2 in Tetris: can rotate the piece [kanikani].
- More Counter Steer progress [Angelo Salese].
- Added PCB layout for Jumping Break and additional information. Corrected the sound clocks on PCBs that only have a 28MHz OSC. Only Super Lup Lup Puzzle has the 14.318180MHz OSC. Rearranged the ROM def section to group the F-E1-16-0xx PCB based games in order [Brian Troha].
- troangel: better support of line scroll with wrap. The scroll offsets are split in LOW byte and HIGH byte [Robiza].
- Add specific support for NEC VR4300/4310 CPUs [R. Belmont].
- Fixed paletteram in Super Crowns Golf. Hooked up text background [Angelo Salese].
- Updated CHD hashes [Yasuhiro Ogawa, Aaron Giles, David Haywood].
- Added default eeprom to skullfng, so that it appears less broken by default (doesn't boot without one) [David Haywood].
- wc90b1 and wc90b2: fix fg and bg vertical scroll [Robiza].
- Implemented a multi-sprite bit in toaplan2 driver [Robiza].
- Changed mapping of start key in multfish.c to standard key (1) like other gambling games, added extra set [David Haywood].
- Fixed bug where chdman -extract would not truncate to the logical size [Aaron Giles].
- Silenced out heavy accesses to Sound RAM expansion area for 'Stress Busters' [Angelo Salese].
- Added better descriptions and dates to a number of drivers in the mamedriv.c file [Yasuhiro Ogawa].
- Minor hack to fix start countdown sound bug in the Buggy Boys [Phil Bennett].

  * Modelled ZX Spectrum audio circuit in SwitcherCAD and derived resistor values for AY-3-891 MIPS III: Update RA before executing the delay slot [R. Belmont].
- Added inputs for galaxia and astrowar. Galaxia is semi-playable. Note: After inserting a coin, it can take a few seconds to respond [Robbbert].
- Fixed build of ldplayer on OS X. Since the CUSTOM sound module no longer exists, I arbitrarily changed it to WAVE, as ar gets upset if it has no input files. I also removed the -all_load flag for ldplayer from the main makefile as it upsets the linker on OS X [Vas Crabb].
- Fix build for PPC64 Linux. (This slightly messes up static branch prediction hints on OS X and AIX, but OS X for PPC64 is dead, and no-one builds MAME for AIX, and it will still build, anyway) [Vas Crabb].
- Paramaterise the arguments to check for NULL in the ATTR_NONNULL macro rather than just checking the first argument. This requires compiler support for C99 variadic macros (MSVC2005 and GCC4 have this AFAIK) [Vas Crabb].
- Z80PIO: When outputting from a port to the hardware in pio mode 3, only those bits defined by the mask should be output. Mame currently outputs everything [Robbbert].
- Changed the One-Shot List or Selectable value cheats to display "Set" instead of "Off". Also stopped the cheat options being activated in order when you are going through the possibilities in this case. These cheats are now activated by pressing ENTER after you have chosen an option [Pugsy].
