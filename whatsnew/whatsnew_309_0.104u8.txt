---------------------------------------
IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: osd_logerror is no longer used. Rather, for error logging you provide a handle to a mame_file in the options.logfile field. If you leave this set to NULL, no
logging will be done.

Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed hyhoo which was broken in the last round of changes [Takahiro Nogi].
- Added emulation of the Alpha 8201/8301 MCU, and connected it to champbbj, champbb2, talbot, shougi, shougi2, and exctsccr [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Added cpunum_set_clock_period(), a variation of cpunum_set_clock() that takes subseconds_t, providing better granularity [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed most of the remaining issues in 'Wink', though there is still some unemulated protection [HIGHWAYMAN, Nicola Salmoria, Pierpaolo Prazzoli] .
- Added save state support to the galaga.c and segaybd.c based games. Improved the "out of context" error message to indicate the source  of the problem [Andre Hufschmidt].

- Fixed second SN76496 on 'Congo Bongo' to have the correct frequency [Aaron Giles, Chris Law].
- Hooked up Sega Universal Sound Board to 'Pig Newton' [Aaron Giles].
