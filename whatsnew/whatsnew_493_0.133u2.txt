- Added preliminary sound to 39in1, still buggy [MooglyGuy].
- Hand-tuned BGM tempo in Tryout thanks to a side-by-side reference [Angelo Salese].
- SNES fixes (mostly MESS specific) [Angelo Salese]:
  * Fixed Super Kick Boxing booting and sound;
  * Preliminary open bus emulation for allowing Shien's Revenge/Shien the Blade Chaser to boot;
  * Fixed mode 5/6 bg drawing cutted in half bug;
  * Fixed (presumably) broken gfxs in nss_sten;
  * More accurate behaviour of the last scroll register;
  * Improved mode 5/6 gfxs when tile size = 16x16;
  * Fixed rowscroll line bugs in many games;
  * Made the unsupported reads on i/o open bus, fixed a layer enable in Super Kick Boxing;
  * Fixed vram size when in hires mode;
  * Hooked up interlace mode;

  * Even more aggressive open bus fixes;
  * Fixed a partial update bug when the screen is in interlace mode;

- Patched progolfa ROM like progolf. Removed bad dump flag in progolf; with progolfa you get the same ROM error in test mode and progolfa have different encryption [robiza].
- Added a stop4 input to slot default and remapped slot default keys to better suit Amcoe games [Fabio Priuli].
- Updated sfbonus.c to use the new gambling inputs. Fixed many years and descriptions. Reworked parent/clone relationships so that parent is the higher revision and/or the Export version. Also, tried to establish common rules in the choice of the romset names [Fabio Priuli].
- Added default input mappings for Hanafuda games. Updated most of the Hanafuda games to use them. Like for Mahjong games, keys A->H are used. "Yes" is mapped to M, "No" is mapped to N [Fabio Priuli].
- Add correct color PROM for panther [Mr. Do, Angelo Salese].
- Removed fake P3 Start from Nichibutsu mahjong games and properly called "Credit Clear" that input. Also, added back Bet button in nb1413m3.c fixing omotesnd [Fabio Priuli].
- nmk16.c driver documentation update / clean up [Briah Troha]:
  * Moved the PCB layout for S.B.S Gomorrah (Bio-Ship Paladin) down by the game's romdef;
  * Added PCB layout for Spectrum 2000 & corrected company name to YONA Tech;
  * Added PCB layout for Red Hawk;
  * Moved decryption routines (if needed) to between the info/PCB layout header and game romdef.
- Added the 8751 MCU code to Saigo no Nindou (nspiritj) [Guru, David Haywood].
- Implemented preliminary bg map banking in 18 Holes Pro Golf [Angelo Salese, Robiza].
- Fixed a mapping error with Maikobana [BET] (mmaiko) which caused the NVRAM not to save correctly [Tafoid].
- Aristocrat MK-4 HW: Hooked up mc6845, fixed a ROM crc in goldenc and implemented flip y [Angelo Salese].
- DIP switch cleanups in gberet, mainevt, ninjakd2, and taito_z [kanikani].
- Added GAME_IMPERFECT_SOUND flag to all sets that use external samples which were not already flagged for sound. Flagged Speed Freak (speedfrk) as GAME_SUPPORTED_SAVE to match the rest of the driver [Tafoid].
- SNES video updates [Fabio Priuli]:
  * Re-enabled video debug functionalities in debug build (to toggle background layers);
  * Added proper priority tables for various bg/obj layers;
  * Largely simplified tile and line drawing routines, and fixed small bits here and there;
  * Further simplification of tile drawing routines;
  * Added palette index to 8bpp tiles (correct color_shift still unsure, though);
  * Reworked video drawing routine to simplify the various graphic mode drawing and to allow proper implementation of priority orders (especially bg3 priority bit and mode 7 priority order);
  * Improved mode 7 extbg (still missing mosaic);
  * Added some more debugging options;
  * Improved Mode 7 math precision (but still some issues remain) and added a few elements to PPU struct;
  * Implemented Mosaic in Mode 7;
  * Merged OAM functions;
  * Added a few elements to PPU struct (this might be handy if we ever come to convert SNES PPU to a device);
  * Fixed Mode 7 shared scrolling/matrix registers;
  * Slightly optimized Mode 7 math (by using Anomie's recursive formula);
  * Moved some more register contents to PPU struct;
  * Added PPU1/PPU2 Open Bus support, STAT77/STAT78 registers should be more accurate (even if still not perfect);
  * Simplified window masking code and moved some more regs to PPU struct.
- More NES work [Robert Bohms]:
  * Fixed bug in nes_apu that caused errors reading $4015;
  * Added length counter status bits to $4015;
  * Fixed 4-screen mirroring (PPU regression);
  * Fixed cham24;
  * Improved Sprite Overflow emulation of NES PPU (this fixes the first of blargg's Sprite Overflow tests).
- Added remaining PCB "U" locations to roms that didn't have for G-Stream G2020 [Brian Troha].
- Atomiswave updates [R. Belmont, Cah4e3]:
  * Hooked up flash ROM at 0;
  * Use proper AW memory map;
  * Emulate AW ROM board (different from Naomi).
- Fixed buggy breakpoints in the g65816 cpu core [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed Atomiswave COIN ERROR [Wind];
- n8080 update [Team Japump!!!]:
  * Corrected ROM names for Space Fever and SF High Splitter;
  * Renamed (spacefeva) to (spacefevo2);
  * Added spacefevo;
  * Added highspltb.
- Updated Sega Hikaru readme [Guru].
- Discrete sound update [Couriersud]:
  * Added "abs" function to DISCRETE_TRANSFORM;
  * Fixed a bug in DISCRETE_RCDISC5.

  * Moved discrete sound related pieces such as initialization into audio/galaxian.h;
  * Split some memory maps into sound related and not sound related parts;
  * Added possibility in discrete.h to select hardware (galaxian/mooncresta) at compile time. This leads to slightly different volume levels. Hit sound (explosion) has been hacked to increase volume. Currently, we can not accurately model the switch/opamp filter circuit;
  * Rewrote timer code so that the pitch timer is only used when it produces audible results.
- Cojag/jaguar video updates (primarily for MESS) [Robbbert]:
  * Added variable pixel width;
  * Fixed display of screens wider than 360 pixels;
  * Enabled use of RGB16.
- looping: Modified the cop420 ROM region, fixed MCU ROM region in clone set, added MCU support [robiza].
- Redumped bingor2 program roms [Klaus Sommers].
- Corrected Kamakazi III's DIP switch setting (the same as superg) and relabeled it a superg hack. Also the DIP switch setting for the Taito license was the same as superg so I eliminated one [Brian Troha].
- Improved speaker-toggle emulation with alias filter [Anders Hallstrom].
- NES: Fixed bank switching in multigm3 (broken due to a mistake of mine when including original Rob Bohms' code). The game still refuses to work, unfortunately [Fabio Priuli].
- vsnes update [Team Japump!!!]:
  * Fixed ROM names;
  * Added vssoccerj.
- ROM name fixes for sicv, sisv, and sisv2 [Team Japump!!!].

- Fixed sprite wrapping in sonson [hap].
- Added Intel 4004 CPU core [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Converted the tilemap lists to be private information held by the running_machine instead of global variables. Added new APIs to the tilemap code to handle the "ALL_TILEMAPS" cases, and removed the old ALL_TILEMAPS definition [Atari Ace].
- Added redumped gfx ROM on Shogun Warrior [Guru].
- Updated romload.c and validity.c to not rely on global variables [Atari Ace].
- Corrected resistor values in Cliff Hanger discrete sound based on actual PCB values [Ruben Panossian].
- Removed DAA tables from the 8085 and Z180 implementations in favor of just computing the values. Also fixed code in 8085 to prevent accidental multiple reads due to macro overuse [hap].
- Added game time and coinage DIP switches to Space Walk, along with service mode and test. Also added support for the 2nd controller and coin counter. Removed GAME_NOT_WORKING as it is working fine. Added color overlay based on photo [hap].
- Added a simple color overlay for Depthcharge based on flyers [hap].
- Updated the Konami twin16 driver. Functional changes [hap]:
  * Improved sprite status register, this fixed the rogue sprites problem in devilw;
  * Added fround coin counters;
  * Lowered k007232 volume;
  * Added savestate support;
  * Added shadows;
  * Fixed devilw and gradius2 sprite lag;
