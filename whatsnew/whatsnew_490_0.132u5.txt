Source changes:
---------------
- DIP switch update [kanikani]:
  * Fixed default setting of jjsquawk, marked the game as IMPERFECT_SOUND, and added some notes;
  * Added DIPLOCATION for toypop and liblrabl.
- Intel 8255A PPI [Aaron Giles]:
  * Added a new implementation of the I8255A device. Rewritten from scratch to properly support handshaking in modes 1 and 2;
  * Refactored sg1000a.c to use the new implementation.
- Redumped Konami Viper CF and NVRAM for all games and updated drivers [Guru, Angelo Salese].
- Fixed Aqua Jet sample ROM loading offset again [Phil Bennett].
- Fixed screen masking and left screen call drawing in tmmjprd [Angelo Salese].
- Added hardware notes to the Quake Arcade Tournament driver [vidpro1, Andrew Gardner].
- Added mechanism for the laserdisc core to return 0 for the philips codes if video is squelched. Updated the Gottlieb and Cliff Hanger drivers to request it this way, since they decode externally [Aaron Giles].
- Made a couple of minor tweaks to the Cliff Hanger driver. Fixed interrupt timing (was not taking into account interlacing) to fix up glitches in playback and ensure the disk test passes. Added SHA1 and marked the game as working [Aaron Giles].
- Promoted Final Lap 2 & Final Lap 3 to working since they just require to init their analog controls (same sequence as Final Lap R) [Angelo Salese].
- Added basic support in bitmap.c for 64-bit indexed bitmaps. As a result, you will need a full recompile with this change, since the bitmap formats enum was altered [Aaron Giles].
- Introduced new feature -burnin, which can be used to generate a PNG that represents the overall brightness seen during the course of running a game. This PNG can be used as a fake "bezel" that overlays the screen via the artwork systems (with a low alpha, say 0.1 or 0.2) to simulate running a game with a monitor that has been burned in from another game [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed the -crsshairpath option to be spelled properly [Aaron Giles].
- Made pr8210 serial processing a little more robust [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed year for Mighty Monkey (and clones) based on US Copyright Searches [Braille].
- ARM7 updates [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz]:
  * Prepped to support multiple architecture versions;
  * Added ARM9 CPU type (ARMv5TE);
  * Added mostly-stubbed system coprocessor/MMU support.
- Fixed resource leak in core_fload() [Aaron Giles].
- Added flashv2.u30 (v2 bios) to the taitogn driver [Joerg Hartenberger].
- Added IDE Lock mechanism to the IDE Driver in MAME, so games on gnet v2 bios are working correct now (idectrl.c / idectrl.h) & taitogn.c [Joerg Hartenberger].
- Further improvements for Shogun Warriors [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina]:
  * Decoded tables for several of the startup commands, made some observations, was unable to properly decode table 0x80, second byte scrambling is odd, so just using extract data right now;
  * Properly mapped inputs in Shogun Warriors;
  * Decodes a block of data used by the Japanese version (fjbuster) for the character select screen. Basically block 0x40 is the same as MCU block/table 0x41, but using different encryption (inline encryption table + additional overlay table instead of each byte being bit shifted).
- Updated Jockey Club II notes [David Haywood, Gerald].
- Verified Fruits & Bunny PROM [f205v].
- Added new split tool that can be used for splitting giant files with per-file hashes and without corrupting them [Aaron Giles].
