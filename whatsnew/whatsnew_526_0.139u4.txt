Source changes:
---------------
- Converted amiga drivers to use driver_devices. Merged common code between legacy Amiga and AGA video systems [Atari Ace].
- Death to more NVRAM_HANDLERS [Aaron Giles].
- cdda: Added a per-channel volume setting function [Barry Rodewald].
- m68k: Add more conditionals and FGETEXP instruction [R. Belmont].
- Converted x2212 to a modern device. Changed x2212 device to return unmapped bits for the upper 4 bits. Added e2prom address space to x2212 so that the latched contents can be viewed. Updated starwars and firefox. Hooked up x2212 in foodf [Aaron Giles].
- Changed ccastles and cloud9 to use the x2212 instead of the hacked-up fake version they had [Aaron Giles].
- Enable vertical scroll bars in debugger comboboxes, and resize them to show the full text [Aaron Giles].
- Changed memory width stubs to fill unpopulated regions with the appropriate portion of the unmap value [Aaron Giles].
- Added ER2055 device. Changed liberator over to using it. Other Atari games to follow [Aaron Giles].
- Modernized liberator driver, added save state support. Moved generalized EAROM handling to atarigen [Aaron Giles].
- Added new (modern) address map macros for referencing member functions in base classes: AM_READ_BASE(_class, _member), AM_WRITE_BASE, AM_READWRITE_BASE, etc. [Aaron Giles].

- raiden2: checkpoint current state [Olivier Galibert].
- Removed IRQ hack in Niyanpai HW [Angelo Salese].

- Put the SH2 DMA on a timer. This is needed because 'Knuckles Chaotix' on the 32X can't be done with 'Instant DMA' due the SH2 DMA is used to read from a FIFO port which is being filled by the 68k during the transfer [David Haywood].
- Fixed 8-bit dram (framebuffer) access for 32x [David Haywood].
- Added sprite buffering to Mirage Youjuu Mahjongden, confirmed by a real PCB video [Angelo Salese].
- 680x0: '030 MMU now emulates translation cache; fixed misinterpreted MMU opcodes [R. Belmont].
- Megadrive: changed way the z80 window into 68k space works so that it automatically can handle things like the 32x [David Haywood].

- Fixed a SH-2 with TSTM opcode [R. Belmont].
- Neo-Geo updates [Johnboy]:
  * savagere, kizuna: Reverted C1 change from u2 (chip was bad, C1 was correct);
  * gururin: Added correct M1 ROM;
  * quizdai2: Tagged as MVS and AES version;
  * Started to document mask ROM types.
- naomi.c: Added Mamonoro cartridge description [f205v].
- viper.c: Added the 941a01 BIOS and p911e missing NVRAM dump [John Bud @ Jamma+].
- Golden Poker driver updates [Roberto Fresca]:

  * Added 3 new Falcons Wild sets (from 3 different hardwares);
  * Hooked the second CPU (still encrypted) to the Falcon hardware;
  * Partially decrypted the second CPU program from Falcon hardware;
  * Figured out the Falcons Wild (Video Klein) memory map and machine;
  * Defeated the evil Video Klein's Witch Card hardware;
  * Reworked inputs for some sets;
  * Added lamps layouts/connections to the new sets;
  * Figured out the multiplexed data/address from Falcon's boards sound;
  * Added full sound support to Falcon hardware;
  * Reorganized and partially cleaned-up the driver;
  * Added more technical notes.

- Fix bug where multiple sampleof attributes could be output, resulting in invalid XML [Aaron Giles].
- Enable wavwrite (and aviwrite) sound even if -nosound is specified [Aaron Giles].
- Since PNG writing is used for MNG as well, switch back to default compression instead of best compression in order to keep the performance reasonable [Aaron Giles].
- Fix another Clang issue [Balrog].
- SH2DRC: Fix BSRF and JSR so delay slot insns can trash the calculated PR if they want [R. Belmont].
- v9938: Set default value for status register 4 and 6  [Michael Zapf].
- Added INT1, INT2, INT3, DRQ0, DRQ1, TMRIN0, TMRIN1 input and TMROUT0, TMROUT1 output lines to the Intel 80186 CPU interface [Curt Coder].
- sh2: fix PC relative MOV in delay slot. Further improvements to PC_relative loads in the delay slot [R. Belmont].
- Improvements to vpoker.c driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added 5-Aces Poker;
  * Fixed, improved and merged memory map;
  * Fixed the ROM loading;
  * Removed the mame rnd hack from the blitter read handler;

- video/neogeo.c: Call optimize_sprite_data() at VIDEO_RESET (for the convenience of Neo Geo CD) [Barry Rodewald].
- Attempt to untie the shared mapping for all games in zr107.c (midnrun, windheat, waveshrk).  Buttons now have labels and match up to test mode, even if you cannot play the games [Tafoid].
- Fixed vspinbalj (vsnes.c) flipper control and eliminated duplicated inputs [Tafoid].
- Converted render.c objects into C++ objects. Updated all callers [Aaron Giles].
- Improvements to Subsino driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Created proper inputs for all Victor 6 sets;
  * Fixed/extended Magic Train technical notes;
  * Eliminated the 3 undumped bipolar PROMs from Magic Train since these are in fact Darlington Arrays instead of bipolar PROMs.
- Replaced the excessively large Quizard patch scheme with a much smaller 4-byte patch plus basic protection obfuscation simulation [Harmony].
- Found the appropriate patch values for Quizard 2.2 and promoted it to working [Harmony].

- 8237dma.c: Initialize the command register to 0 on reset [Wilbert Pol].
- Update psx drivers to use a driver_device [Atari Ace].
