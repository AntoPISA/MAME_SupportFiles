  * Moved element_component from rendlay.c to rendlay.h.
  * Added ability to rendlay.c to define "container" components. These simply provide a render_container. 
- Added DEBUG_FLAG_OSD_ENABLED to allow coexistence of debuggers going forward. Replaced all occurrences of OPTION_DEBUG in src/osd/* by checking machine->debug_flags. Replaced all occurrences of DEBUG_FLAG_ENABLED in src/osd/* by DEBUG_FLAG_OSD_ENABLED For the time being, DEBUG_FLAG_OSD_ENABLED is default (set in mame.c) [Couriersud].

- Documentation update for Hotdog Storm, IE: The PCB ID number and tile map chip info [Brian Troha].
- Add and hook up ZOOM ZSG-2 skeleton [Olivier Galibert].
- Doesn't do much at the moment, but the increase in documentation value is significant (we're documenting the sample compression format, for one thing).
- New driver for Sigma B52 system. ACRTC implementation is a bit hacky due to its preliminary emulation status [Roberto Fresca].
- lethal.c: Verified clocks and vsync from orginal PCB [Corrado Tomaselli].

- hng64: Initial implementation of 0x10-sized palette pages for 3D objects. This makes most environment colors correct in (sams64) [Andrew Gardner].
- via6522: Read port A/B only if some pins are inputs [Curt Coder].
- Fixed DIP switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code) for (dambustr) and clones [stephh].
- Internal debugger using the mame rendering infrastructure [Couriersud]:
  * Added support for arbitrary number of containers for render_target.
  * Added command-line parameter -debug_internal (-di) to use the internal debugger when in debug mode.
  * Internal debugger supports all views except memory view.
  * Added "Debug" view to layout/vertical.lay to create more place for debug views in vertical games.
- NOTE: The colors are ugly. Font rendering needs improvement. There are no shortcut keys right now. There is still a lot of room for more improvements. However, it works and does not depend on any UI toolkit. The interface has been designed to support displaying views programmatically e.g. from the UI [Aaron Giles].
- Short HowTo [Aaron Giles]:
  * Start MAME with "-debug -di".
  * Console, register and disasm views will be shown. Place them by dragging the view on the title bar.
  * Views can be resized by dragging the bottom-right yellow square.
  * The view having the focus has a green background title bar.
  * Hit "Tab" (IPT_UI_CONFIGURE) to show the menu.
  * Console and disasm views support a very simple facility to support entering commands and addresses. Just start typing. Hit "enter" when finished.
