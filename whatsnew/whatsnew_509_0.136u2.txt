Source changes:
---------------
- Replaced vsnetscr GFX ROMs with correct dumps [Team Japump, Dumping Union].
- Fixed memory allocation issue in debug builds [Aaron Giles].
- Added makefile autotest for BIGENDIAN. A bit hacked, though [Couriersud].
- Redumped sound roms in Cyber Tank [Antonio Gonzalez Jr., Dumping Union].
- psikyosh improvements [PsikyoFan]:
  * Add support for per-scanline scroll/zoom and per-column effects. This is adds a significant performance penalty when enabled. Removed warning flag from (s1945ii) and (s1945iii). (s1945iii) needs confirmation of correctness and x-zoom is a guess;
  * Virtually completed video rendering. Only flipscreen missing (and conversion to tilemaps one day). Per-line effects now respect per-line alpha, priority and bank. As a result daraku text works without any hacks;
  * Added various optimisations to get back all games to a playable speed;
  * Fixed missing soldivid effect on final boss that was broken due to above daraku hack;
  * Added accurate scaling effects based on measurements from hardware.
- cybertnk improvements [Angelo Salese]:
  * Fixed sprite height;
  * Implemented flip x and negative y offsets;
  * Implemented preliminary zooming.
- sdl.mak rewrite [Couriersud]:
  * TARGETOS=freebsd may now be given on make invocation;
  * Modular approach, separate sections for opengl, x11, debugger;
  * Most target specific settings parametrized;
  * Added GTL_INSTLL_ROOT to optionally build win32 with the MAME debugger;
  * On targets supporting "-m64" and "-m32" use them;
  * On unix ppc targets, add -Dpowerpc automatically.
- Improved stack walking on crash in Windows. Now using StackWalk64 to do the stack walk, resulting in cleaner logs. Also will try to use system function to look up symbol and source/line information if present [Aaron Giles].

- Created new template class tagged_list which manages a simple list along with a tagmap. Changed memory regions, input ports, and devices to use this class. For devices, converted typenext and classnext fields into methods which dynamically search for the next item. Changed a number of macros to use the features of the class, removing the need for a bunch of helper functions [Aaron Giles].
- Replaced device_find_child_by_tag() -> device->subdevice() [Aaron Giles].
- Added Am29000 CPU core [Phil Bennett].
- Removed stdlib.h from osdcomm.h [Couriersud]:
  * Added #include stdlib.h where now necessary;
  * Fixed Solaris build;
  * Fixed building unidasm for OSD=sdl on win32.
- Tools now include stdlib.h where needed [Couriersud].
- Changed core library files to use osd_malloc/osd_free where appropriate [Couriersud].
- Added checkautodetect target to makefile [Couriersud].
- Permit zlib and expat to be linked dynamically without changing the makefile by specifying "=0": make BUILD_ZLIB=0 BUILD_EXPAT=0 [Couriersud].
- Improved vsnet sprite/roz alignment [David Haywood].
- Converted the following drivers to use a driver_data structure [Atari Ace]:
  * bigstrkb, mugsmash, pass, sbugger, sderby, shadfrce, shootout, silkroad, spbactn, sslam, stlforce, taitojc, tunhunt, welltris, wwfsstar, xyonix;
  * 39in1, safarir, sbowling, shougi, skeetsht, skyarmy, sliver, spoker, spool99, srmp5, srmp6, ssingles, sstrangr, sub, supdrapo, superdq, supertnk, suprgolf.
- hng64: Implemented low-res texture decoding. All red/green polygons should now be textured [Andrew Gardner].
- Correct a long-standing design flaw: device configuration state is now separate from runtime device state [Aaron Giles]:
  * There is a new class 'running_device' which represents the state of a live device. A list of these running_devices sits in machine->devicelist and is created when a running_machine is instantiated;
  * To access the configuration state, use device->baseconfig() which returns a reference to the configuration;
  * The list of running_devices in machine->devicelist has a 1:1 correspondance with the list of device configurations in machine->config->devicelist, and most navigation options work equally on either (scanning by class, type, etc.);
  * For the most part, drivers will now deal with running_device objects instead of const device_config objects. In fact, in order to do this patch, I did the following global search and replace:

  const device_config   -> running_device
  device->static_config -> device->baseconfig().static_config
  device->inline_config -> device->baseconfig().inline_config

     and then fixed up the compiler errors that fell out;
  * Removed device_get_info_* functions and replaced them with methods called get_config_*;
  * Added methods for get_runtime_* to access runtime state from the running_device;
  * DEVICE_GET_INFO callbacks are only passed a device_config *. This means they have no access to the token or runtime state at all. For most cases this is fine;
  * Added new DEVICE_GET_RUNTIME_INFO callback that is passed the running_device for accessing data that is live at runtime. In the future this will go away to make room for a cleaner mechanism;
  * Cleaned up the handoff of memory regions from the memory subsystem to the devices.
- Fix bug introduced with astring changes that caused malformed tokens when writing out cfg files [Aaron Giles].
- Fix bug where memory regions were not properly enumerated for the debugger memory view. Also, stop creating empty regions for disk regions [Aaron Giles].
- Added Guru(TM)-readme to (trackfld) [Curt Coder].
- Refactored the CIA 6526 interface, adding SP/CNT callbacks. Fixed serial transfer [Curt Coder].
- Converted the rest of devintrf to classes and moved management functions into methods of those classes. The most wide-ranging change was converting device_reset() to device->reset(). Apart from that it was mostly internal shuffling in the core [Aaron Giles].
- Added OS/2 autodetect to makefile [Couriersud].
- Autodetection of PTR64 can be inhibited now by specifying PTR64=0. On mixed 32bit/64bit targets identifying themselves as 64bit this can be used to build a 32bit executable [Couriersud].
- Added OpenBSD support in makefile/sdl.mak. Fixed XBSD detection of PTR64 (uses amd64) [Couriersud].
- Fix bug that mistook a non-NULL token to mean that a device was started. Fixes -video ddraw issue [Aaron Giles].
- Replaced vsnes bank installs with RAM installs, since the banks were never changed [Aaron Giles].
- Exit from the unhandled exception filter cleanly now. Use SetErrorMode() to disable the appearance of dialog boxes when crashes occur [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed a typo in pgm.c that was causing a memory test error and corrected some comments [XingXing].
- Made direct accessors for device configuration state. Currently they just call through to the get info function. Removed old macros that wrapped calls [Aaron Giles].
- Removed some aliases between CPUINFO_ and DEVINFO_ to help clarify usage. Also converted a few more places to use the new accessors [Aaron Giles].
- Replaced drgninja set with one dumped from a genuine Data East PCB [dlfrsilver].
- Added MEC-M1 PCB layout to the dec0 driver and updated some clocks and ROM names [Guru].
- hng64: Partially decodes translation-only geometry type 0102. This makes the road appear in the racing games, the edge of the ring in buriki, and a hallway during the buriki attract [Andrew Gardner].
- The return of the "misc" [Couriersud]:
  * Added sdlmisc_<targetos>.c again. This was necessary since certain tools create stubs for e.g. osd_break_into_debugger. If we do not have this in a separate file, the link stage may break;
  * Applied OS/2 patch [Credit: KO Myung-Hun];
  * Cleaned up #includes. Removed stdlib.h were possible;
  * More malloc to osd_malloc rename;
  * SDL monitor modes are read now when they are needed. This is now consistent across platforms.
- GTK Debugger work [Couriersud]:
  * glade-2 can now be used again to edit the debug.glade file;
  * No more need to edit the files created by glade-2;
  * All "activate" handlers now pass the parent window pointer;
  * malloc ==> osd_malloc to prevent mixed c++/c window allocations;
  * Run to cursor (main view);
  * In place memory editing (memory view);
  * implement key handling (Up, down, ..) like in windows;
  * Tab and ESC not yet handled;
  * Functionality now matches win32 debugger;
  * Further code review/rewrite/simplification;
  * Added more comment headings;
  * Fix a compile warning for gcc-4.4 (not detected by gcc-4.2);
  * Horizontal divider bar to individually size views;
  * Minimum height aligned to win32 debugger.
- ARM: Preliminary SA-1110 support [R. Belmont].
- Verified all deco32 clocks and corrected HuC6280 clock following old Charles McDonald notes I had about internal divisor. Added a note on the Arm cpu used by this game: it's a Data East 101 custom [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Changed the following games to use the 76489A variant (verified on my PCBs): "Green Beret", "Do Run Run", "Mr.Do's Castle", "Jail Break", "Shaolin's Road", "Yie Ar Kung-Fu" [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Fixed sn76489a periodic noise once again (and simplified a bit of code), now should be closer to or match real chips as sampled. Added true clock divider emulation, so emulation may be a bit slower [Lord Nightmare, PlgDavid, Kold666].
- Popmessages can now be used in drivers which have an MC6845 [Curt Coder].
- Ensure that RAM and bitmaps are cleared when the ms32 driver is started to avoid 64-bit build crashes [David Haywood].
- Converted HD63484 ACRTC to be device [Fabio Priuli].
- hng64: Hacks the camera to work in sams64 [Andrew Gardner].
- Fixed crash issues with mchampdx [Fabio Priuli].
- s14001a: Updated comments; got rid of the squealing noise (hidden behind a #define now, code is still there) until some other issues can be resolved [Lord Nightmare].
- Dumped the proms in "D-Day (Jaleco)" [Chack'n, Team Japump].
- Fixed background and sprites colors in "D-Day (Jaleco)" [Angelo Salese].
- UI menu interface changes [Couriersud]:
  * All UI functions now expect a render_container;
  * Removed all macros referencing render_container_get_ui;
  * ui_menu_alloc now is passed a container to which to render the menu.
