----------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: CONFIGURATION AND HIGH SCORE SAVE FILES HAVE BEEN MOVED. MAKE SURE YOU MOVE THE OLD ONES TO THE NEW DIRECTORIES "CFG" AND "HI". This will be done automatically by the provided batch file mov.bat, but PLEASE read on for details.
NOTE: 'Bubble Bobble' doesn't work in this release. We are aware of that. Use 'Bobble Bobble' or 'Super Bobble Bobble" instead, they work much better than "Bubble Bobble' ever did.

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Accurate colors in [Tim Lindquist, Nicola Salmoria]:
  * Donkey Kong Jr.
  * Congo Bongo
  * Phoenix
  * 10 Yard Fight
  * Moon Patrol
  * Pop Flamer
  * War of the Bugs
  * Espial (not sure about this one - red and blue could be inverted)
  * Super Cobra
  * Yie Ar Kung-Fu
  * Mario Bros.
  * Super Basketball
  * Seicross
  * 1943
  * Donkey Kong 3 (well, not really)
  * Gyruss
  * Crazy Kong
  * Zaxxon (is getting there; sprites are mostly correct, background isn't)
- Accurate colors in 'Bagman' and 'Super Bagman' [Tim Lindquist, Jarek Burczynski].
- Accurate colors in 'Naughty Boy' (probably) [Virtu-Al, Nicola Salmoria].
- Minor fix to 'Donkey Kong' colors (black was dark blue) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Clouds in 'Time Pilot' are correct [Edward Massey].
- Lives left are correctly displayed in 'Burger Time', sprites are turned off appropriately, and the switch test in test mode works correctly. The hardware of this game is more similar to 'Eggs' than I thought [Nicola Salmoria].
- Some fixes to '10 Yard Fight' [John Butler].
- The background was clipped too low in 'Phoenix' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added the missing scrolling background to 'Exed Exes' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed sprite/character priority in 'Gyruss' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed blinking in the 'Galaga' starfield [Martin Scragg].
- 'Galaga' supports rotation (-ror and -rol) [Nicola Salmoria].


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------
- All the Williams games. Samples are no longer needed and may be deleted [Steven Hugg, Mirko Buffoni, Nicola Salmoria].
- 'Q*Bert Qubes': You just have to use Q*Bert's sound ROMs, they are the same [Fabrice Frances].
- 'Tac/Scan' (through samples) [Brad Oliver].
- Fixed some sound problems in 'Asteroids' [Andrew Scott].
- Added music to 'Kick' [Aaron Giles].
- Improved the 'Galaxian' background hum, it also is no longer incorrectly played in 'Moon Cresta' and others [Andrew Scott].
- Digital audio in the Taito games (used for some sound effects, most notably Tarzan's yell in 'Jungle King'). Also, music plays in 'Jungle King' [Nicola Salmoria].
- 'Moon Patrol', '10 Yard Fight', 'Kung Fu Master' [Aaron Giles].
- 'Mario Bros.' (partial, through samples) [Brad Oliver, Shane Monroe].
- 'Eggs' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed the sound in 'Omega Race'. It was playing too slow. Thanks to Stacy Joe Dunkle, Mike Cuddy and Al Kossow [Bernd Wiebelt].
- 'Congo Bongo' (samples are needed to get full sound) [Ville Laitinen, Tim Lindquist].


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------
- 'Moon Patrol', 'Rally X', 'Vanguard', 'Super Cobra', 'Turtles', 'Xevious', 'Galaxy Wars' [Valerio Verrando].
- Fixed 'Krull' and 'Donkey Kong 3' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed 'Galaga' [Valerio Verrando].
- 'Starforce', 'Jump Bug', 'Bagman', 'Super Bagman', 'Time Pilot 84', 'Warp Warp' [Juan Carlos Lorente].


Other drivers improvements:
---------------------------
- The attract mode of 'Galaga' works correctly. 'Qix' runs correctly and without slowdowns. Test mode in 'Mr. Do's Castles' & family works correctly, (dip switches in Do's Castle still don't work). All these changes are due to the interleaved CPU execution described below [Nicola Salmoria].
- New fix to avoid lockup in 'Tempest' after 150,000 points - this one should really work [Keith Gerdes].
- Fixed the Fantasy driver [Brian Levine].
- Several fixes and enhancements to the Williams driver [Aaron Giles].
- Several fixes to the Williams driver: 'Blaster' is finished, 'Sinistar' is playable but there are some blitter bugs, 'Bubbles' is better but still resets itself from time to time [Marc Lafontaine].
- Fixed bug in 'Naughty Boy' coin insertion/start game handling [Nicola Salmoria].
- Some fixes to the 'Star Wars' mathbox [Aaron Giles].
- The hardware of the Taito games ('Elevator Action', 'Jungle King', 'Wild Western', 'Front Line') is emulated more faithfully. Playfield priority is accurate in 'Jungle King', however this broke 'Wild Western' - strange. Front Line works. Merged all the drivers into taito.c [Nicola Salmoria].
- Tried to plug 'Triple Punch' into the Scramble driver, but it doesn't work [Nicola Salmoria].
- Support for 'New Rally X'; colors are accurate in 'New Rally X' ONLY - still wrong in 'Rally X' until we find the color PROMs. Sound should finally be correct, both in 'Rally X' and 'New Rally X' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Video drawing optimization to 'Mappy', plus test mode now works both in 'Mappy' and 'Dig Dug 2' [Aaron Giles].
- In some games (e.g. "Pacman', 'Galaxian', 'Rally X') the NumLock and CapsLock leds emulate the 1 player/2 players start lamps [Sean Gugler].
- Fixed dip switches in 'Missile Command' [Marco Cassili].
- Early attempt at a 'Zookeeper' driver, based on the 'Qix' one, which unfortunately doesn't work yet [John Butler, Ed Mueller].
- Moved the 'Hunchback' driver into dkong.c, since that's where it belongs (but it still doesn't work due to encryption) [Nicola Salmoria].


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------
- Added Gamma correction controls. Use Shift + Numeric pad +/- to change it. There are some games which are too dark on the default setting, instead of using the monitor settings use these controls to brighten the picture. Gamma correction also affects colors, like the girders in 'Donkey Kong' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added a "Pro Action Replay"-like cheat finder. It is only available when -cheat is specified on the command line [Marc Lafontaine].
- Some optimizations to the 6809 emulator [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Some optimizations to the 6809, and modified it to always fetch opcodes directly from RAM (much faster). The 'Ghosts 'n Goblins', 'Star Wars' and Williams drivers needed reworking to support that [Aaron Giles].
- Moved configuration and high score files to the CFG and HI subdirectories. They are not stored in the games subdirectories. I have provided a batch file (MOV.BAT) to automatically move your old settings in the new directories. Just start it from inside the MAME directory. It will spit out some error messages for missing files, don't worry and let it finish its job. Having configuration files in a separate directory makes it easier to keep ROMs in .zip files. This is already done by some front-ends, but you can do it from the command line as well, just use this batch file. PKUNZIP must be in your path. The .zip files must be in the MAME directory and named after the game (i.e. pacman.zip):

  @echo off
  md %1
  pkunzip >nul: %1 %1
  MAME.EXE %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
  deltree >nil: /y %1

  But even better, if you have ZipFolders or ZipMagic installed, MAME will automatically look into the .zip or .zif directory. ZipFolders and ZipMagic are trademarks of Mijenix Corporation. You can download a trial version from www.mijenix.com. I am in no way associated with Mijenix Corp. - I'm just a happy costumer [Nicola Salmoria].
- Removed "-trak" and "-mouse" options. Mouse support is now enabled by default. To disable it, use "-nomouse" [Bernd Wiebelt].
- "-vesa" picks the best VESA mode available. The new "-vesa1" forces VESA 1.2 [Bernd Wiebelt].
- "-vg" removed. It is on by default now [Bernd Wiebelt].


Source changes:
----------------
- We are now using the "WIP 2.8" version of Allegro to compile the DOS version. You can get it from http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/ [Nicola Salmoria].
- Two new OSD_KEY definitions: RCONTROL and ALTGR. CONTROL has been replaced by LCONTROL [Nicola Salmoria].
- Aligned to version 1.2 of Marcel de Kogel's Z80 emulator [Nicola Salmoria].
- New memory handling functions, about 10%-30% faster than before. Moved the memory code from cpuintrf.c to memory.c. Banked ROMs can now be handled in a cleaner and faster way. Use the new MRA_BANK1... types in the memory handler arrays, and cpu_setbank() to set the current bank. The Z80 and M6809 emulators natively support bank switching. IMPORTANT: for 24 bit addressing (i.e. 68000) you cannot associate a memory handler to a single byte. You must use four consecutive bytes, longword aligned. This was done to speedup word (2 bytes) and dword (4 bytes) operations [Tatsuyuki Satoh, Aaron Giles].
- New ROM_LOADEVEN and ROM_LOADODD macros [Aaron Giles].
- CPU execution is interleaved. The cpu_slices_per_frame field in the MachineDriver controls how often control is passed from one CPU to another. 1 is the minimum, meaning that each CPU runs for the whole video frame before giving control to the others. The higher this setting, the more closely CPUs are interleaved and therefore the more accurate the emulation is. However, an higher setting also means slower performance [Nicola Salmoria].
- Removed osd_obtain_pen(), the palette is passed to osd_create_display() instead. Also moved clearbitmap() to osd_clearbitmap(), which does a slightly different thing from what clearbitmap() did: it sets the bitmap to be generically "black", which doesn't necessarily imply filling it with Machine->pens[0]. Avoid using osd_clearbitmmap() in drivers: use the new fillbitmap(), instead, which accepts a pen number and a clip region [Nicola Salmoria].
- Replaced file related functions (fopen(), fread() and so on) with osd_ equivalents. This avoids a good amount of hacking in the Mac port; plus it allows some system specific extensions, like supporting ZipMagic/ZipFolders under Windows 95 [Nicola Salmoria].
- Tweaked input port code. Added new fields for analog controls - clip, min, and max. Also added 2 new analog joystick types - IPT_AD_STICK_X and IPT_AD_STICK_Y. The new fields are packed into the same int field (arg) as the sensitivity and as such they can only be in the range of 0-255. The clip field clips the trackball/dial/stick deltas, a common callback routine task. Min and Max are so far only used in the AD_STICK types. They limit the range of motion for those sticks - used in Star Wars and Red Baron [Brad Oliver].
- Additional tweaking of analog inputs, allowing them to be updated more than once per frame. This is needed by some games [Bernd Wiebelt].
- Removed osd_track_center(). We always use relative mouse movement now [Bernd Wiebelt].
- Formalized support for dirty rectangles, via the function osd_mark_dirty(). It is mostly used by MacMAME, limited DOS support added by Bernd Wiebelt [Aaron Giles].
- Updated pokyintf.c to be more like 8910intf.c. Variable clock frequency, port callbacks, a clipping parameter, variable updates per frame. Most noticeably, Tempest has much improved sound with more frequent updates [Brad Oliver].
