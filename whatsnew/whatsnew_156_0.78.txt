Source changes:
----------------------
- Various System 24 Improvements, Fixing Priorities, Clipping issues etc. [Olivier Galibert].
- Improved Lightgun Code/Reload Handling [Bryan McPhail]:
  * '-lightgun' now enables the lightgun only - no button remapping is performed.
  * '-reload' (formally '-offscreen_reload') is now needed for 2nd button presses to map to offscreen shots.
  * '-dual' (formally '-dual_lightgun') adds support for the Actlabs Dual Lightgun setup, it may be used with and without '-reload' and it requires '-lightgun'. 
  This mode attempts to automatically remap the player 1 & 2 buttons to suit the lightgun setup.  If it doesn't work you probably need to delete the .cfg file for that game.
