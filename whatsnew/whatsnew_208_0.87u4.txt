Source changes:
---------------
- Changed instr86.c based on comment below: In the cpu/i86 code emulating the CMPSW instruction there is what seems to be a cut+paste bug: It calls the SUBB() macro where it should call SUBW(). Line 524 of instr86.c [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Changed where source filename based config files are stored to avoid conflicts with set name configs [Ren√© Single].
- Changes the static function implementations in memory.h to inline [Brad Oliver].
- Code to decrypt FD1094 CPU 317-0092 in states 0x00-0xff (0x00 is reset, 0x10 is IRQ) this is the CPU used by tetris, code is not hooked up yet [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed bugs introduced in u3 causing Atari / Midway drivers to crash [Olivier Galibert].
- Improvements to Hyper Neogeo 64 rendering, 3d graphics can now be seen although emulation is still incomplete and Fatal Fury WA still needs a hack to boot [Andrew Gardner, Rasterizing code provided in part by Andrew Zaferakis].
