0.20 1997/05/05 [#022 - Mirko Buffoni]
--------------------------------------


New games added
---------------
(gyruss)   Gyruss [Mirko Buffoni]
(krull)    Krull [Fabrice Frances]


Program changes:
----------------
- Brad Oliver found a lot of bugs around the code. Fixed 1942 background scroll, Arabian video driver, and Phoenix sound init routine (all those caused trashes on MAC).
- Chris Hardly kindly provided a working driver for Warp Warp.
- Dave W. provided a new set of invaders samples. Should be better, though.
- Fabrice Frences provided a driver for Krull. Also fixed some bugs in qbert, and returned audio to Mad Planets.
- Frogger music tempo bring back to original value. Fast but flawless!
- Paul Berberich fixed some colors of Donkey Kong that is now quite close to original arcade. Also Donkey Kong Jr. has better colors now.
- Ron Fries created a new set of Donkey Kong samples, using Mike Cuddy's 8039 emulator. The new samples no longer have static, they are aliased and louder. All names are now generic, so the same name can be used across Nintendo line (DK, DKjr, DK3, Mario).
- Misc. changes [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * 1942 has correct colours. Also fixed ROM paging, so now it has no more slowdowns. Fixed jerkiness. Sound is better, too. How about the tempo?  How about the pitch? Are they right?
  * Fixed missing sprites when exiting from doors in Elevator Action. There are still some sprite priority bugs. Also better colors.
  * Thanks to Marc Lafontaine's invaluable help, Popeye is now fully playable and has 100% accurate colors. Supports high score saving, too. Still very slow.
- Yes!! Finally I wrote a driver for Gyruss, one of my favourite games  and one of the reasons why I started emulation. Big special thanks to Michael Cuddy, without help and information this game would probably never be done; and to Nicola Salmoria that fixed some of the sprites bugs that turned me mad and cleaned the code! ;) [Mirko Buffoni].


Sources changes:
----------------
- Changed 8910intf to support 5 PSGs (Gyruss have them!) [Mirko Buffoni].
- Changes in MAME.C:  added -list option. This is useful for mantaining the readme file. It lists currently supported games. Thanks to Zanello Maurizio for suggestion [Mirko Buffoni].
- Changes in MSDOS.C: vesa and vesascan are now mutex. Also fixed a bug caused by calling joystick initialize before starting allegro [Mirko Buffoni].
- Misc. changes [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * Changed GENERIC.C to add sound_command_latch_r(): this always return the last command, instead of 0, if there are no more pending commands. This was required by 1942.
  * New flag for the cpu type: CPU_AUDIO_CPU. For example, you'll define a CPU type as CPU_Z80 | CPU_AUDIO_CPU. This indicates that the CPU is a slave used for audio only, and is therefore not needed if sound is disabled. The CPU will not be emulated when sound is turned off, therefore speeding up the emulation a lot.
  * Also, 8910_sh_update() doesn't emulate the 8910 audio if sound is disabled (the I/O ports of the chip are still emulated, since some games use them for input).
- To UNIX users: Sorry for the mess I did in my previous distribuition. All names and patches should be ok now [Mirko Buffoni].
