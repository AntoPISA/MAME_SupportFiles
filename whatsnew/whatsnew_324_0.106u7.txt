MAMETesters Bug Fixed (1):
--------------------------
namcond1_0106u3yel (Aaron Giles)


Source changes:
---------------
- Added a compile-time option to rendersw.c to prevent reads from the destination. This removes the ability to do a number of blends and effects, but allows you to point the software renderer at a video memory target and not kill performance. It also improves performance of software rendering in general by avoiding expensive alpha blending operations [Aaron Giles].
- Added back support for DirectDraw. Unlike the old support, this requires DirectX 7 or later. There is now a new option to control what video system is being used for rendering. Use -video d3d to use Direct3D. Use -video ddraw to use DirectDraw. And use -video gdi to force the use of GDI for rendering. Also added back the -hwstretch option to control whether or not DirectDraw does stretching. Added support for the -prescale option when using DirectDraw as well. It should also work ok with multiple screens [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug that messed up partial updating. Hopefully it all should be back to normal again [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed off-by-one drawing error in the 'Pasha Pasha 2' driver [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed some instruction forms in the 6309 diassembler to consume the correct number of bytes [Nicola Salmoria].
- Improved font logic so that small fonts are scaled more appropriately at low resolutions. It's not perfect, but works well for most games when running with the new DirectDraw option, which always renders games at minimum resolution [Aaron Giles].
- Improvements to the 'Sang Ho' driver, making them somewhat playable [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina].
