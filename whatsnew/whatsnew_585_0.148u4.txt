- Adds simple_set data structure and hooked it up to the debugger comment system [Andrew Gardner].
- arcadia.c: Added the SEC-SCPA pal dump used on Magic Johnson's Fast Break and Leader Board [Kevin Eshbach].
- braveff: Added dump of mask ROMs [Guru, R. Belmont].
- Detailed differences in 'Fighting Golf (US)' from parent based on observation and "SNK Program Update" notice which was found which includes a DIPSWITCH change [Tafoid, Shane Chaneman].
- esripsys.c - Fix regression caused by cycle-exact 6809 core [Phil Bennett].
- Fixed MVMVA flag calculation & replicate the bugs when mx is set to 3 or cv is set to 2 [smf].
- Fruit: fix VGA BIOS mirror, RAM amount, and HDD writability [Carl, R. Belmont].
- hikaru: Redumped bad ROMs in braveff and sgnascar as per the test mode checksum tables [Guru].
- iteagle: add 1.02 bootrom, FPGA config ROMs, and PALs [Brian Troha].
- iteagle: Updated documentation [Guru, Brian Troha].
- m6502: Undocumented instruction 0x80 is a 2-byte nop, not a 1-byte one [O. Galibert].
- naomi: Redumped mok, shaktamb, vtennis2, ngdup23a, vf4evo, initdexp, initdv3j, senkosp and initdv3e. Redumped GD-ROMs for cvs2gd, senkoo, and ss2005. GD-ROM redumps for confmiss, sprtjam, vstrik3, dygolf [f205v].

- pacman.c: Verified original puckman roms and made that set the parent [Andy Welburn].
- Partial support for 1f801060 for setting the RAM size, if the size is set larger than the actual memory then RAM is repeated. As a result the RAM is no longer included in the drivers memory map, you have to specify the size in the machine [smf]..
- primrag2: PCB readme shows 8MB RAM, make it so [R. Belmont].
- PSX CPU creates a RAM device, this has exposed a problem with not removing the child devices from the hash map when removing replacing devices. At the moment I have changed device.c so that when any device is removed the hash maps are reset [smf].
- PSX GTE: Improved FLAG calculation in NCDS, CDP, NCDT, NCCS, CC, NCS, NCT & NCCT by checking for overflow after each addition. Fixed RTPT flags calculation & added a new divide implementation that uses a much smaller table. Fixed RTPS flags and calculation [smf].
- QT Debugger: Now saves all settings for all open windows - including docks in the main debug window. Also fixes bug where closing the main window with the X in the corner didn't save settings properly. Adds trackpc command, allowing for a visual display of where the program counter has visited in the dasm windows. Run "help trackpc" in the debugger to see the options [Andrew Gardner].
- SDL: Don't double-shutdown the font cache on *IX when exiting with the debugger enabled [R. Belmont]
- SDL: Fix symlink handling by internal file manager [qmc2].
- segas18.c: Added ddcrewj 317-0185 decryption key [Porchy, Charles MacDonald].
- suna16.c: Added board documentation, added PCB layouts for both styles of Back Street Soccer and Ultra Balloon. Added dipswitch locations to 'Back Street Soccer', 'Ultra Balloon' and 'Best of Best'. Changed CPU clocks to actual OSC based timing [Brian Troha].

- tms5220.c: Based on decap analysis, both the TMS5220 and TMS5220C use identical LPC tables; get rid of the unnecessary extra table [Lord Nightmare, digshadow].
- tms5220.c: Updated many comments, changed a variable name, and made some minor fixes to the 'circuit 412' to better reflect the patent. [Lord Nightmare].
