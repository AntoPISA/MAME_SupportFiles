Source changes:
---------------
- Changed sound banking on Shogun Warriors/B.Rap Boys to use an OKIM6295 address map and banks [David Haywood].
- Removed the MCU comm hack from namcofl/namconb. This now fixes the music tempo in most games [Phil Bennett].
- Fixed vroulet controls so that the Red column can be selected [luigi30].
- 680x0 update [R. Belmont]:
  * Support PMOVE modes from PMMU;
  * Allow the FPU to be used for both '030 and '040;

  * Fixed buggy FPU 64-bit stores in the (An) addressing mode.
- chdman: Add option to create uncompressed writeable HD images for MESS [R. Belmont].

- More goldstar.c improvements.. [Roberto Fresca];
  * Completed the 'New Lucky 8 Lines' and 'New Super 8 Lines' hardware/PCB layout;
