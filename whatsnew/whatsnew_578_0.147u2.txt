Source changes:
---------------
- Added support for DEVCB_UNMAPPED, that will do the logging on read/write of device callback, preventing a need for making dummy log line handlers [Miodrag Milanovic].
- If the start of a multi-line comment is indented then following comment lines will be indented with tabs up to that point [smf].
- Information adjustments for naomi.c, chihiro.c, mame.lst reflecting latest discoveries [f205v].
- New preliminary driver for Webak MPU-12 platform [Roberto Fresca].
- Refactored the code in jedutil to support the  viewing of a GAL16V8 device and added a new command line option of "-viewlist" which will print out a list of all the devices that can be viewed in human readable logic equations. Also updated the jedutil regression test to support passing in an additional argument of "debug" to print out detailed log. Also moved the jedutil regression test data into separate directories composed of the device's name to make things more organized [Kevin Eshbach].
- Removed protection hack patches and emulated protection routines for 'Caveman Ninja' [IQ_132 & JackC].
- Added experimental support for using Berkeley PLA files as input to jedutil [Curt Coder].
- memory: Fix dynamic recursive device mapping [O. Galibert]:
  * You have a device (pc-fdc) with a memory map on it.
  * You map it dynamically into a cpu (maincpu) address space with install_device (isa-fdc does that).
  * The device pc-fdc has a subdevice (upd765).
  * The subdevice upd765 has its own memory map.
  * The pc-fdc memory map includes the upd765 memory map through AM_DEVICE("upd765", ...) Before the fix, the code would search for upd765 as a subdevice of maincpu and not of pc-fdc.
- am9517a: Don't grossly fail on verify [O. Galibert].
- 3X3 Puzzle update [David Haywood]:
  * Fixed visible area.
  * Added the 2nd button.
  * Added the Demo Sound dip.
- 3x3 Puzzle: Fixed sound banking. Added scrolling to '3X3 Puzzle' [Mariusz Wojcieszek].
- SCSI: Uses logical levels rather than voltage levels for control signals, you have to write 0 to the data lines when you're not sending data. Added a kludge to stop the ff from the 6522 from preventing the bus from being read, this may or may not be how the hardware really works [smf].
- i386dasm.c [Peter Ferrie]:
  * Added numerous opcodes for newer CPUs.
  * Added some undocumented-but-supported opcodes from old CPUs.
  * Corrected naming of two opcodes.
- port 0x64 opcode 0xd1 should incur no delay when delivering. This allows, for example, su2000 to start booting to the CMOS setup screen [Peter Ferrie].
- Improved inputs in '3X3 Puzzle' [Stephh].
- Aristocrat MK6 base system bios for New South Wales region [Heihachi_73].
- hercules: Hooked up mechanical sounds [Robbbert].
- memory: Map from the cpu's owner, not the root device, otherwise siblings of cpus coming from config fragments aren't happy [O. Galibert].
- clifront.c: Added verifysoftlist command for verifying software availability for separate software lists [Wilbert Pol].
- Created a base class delegate_common_base for all delegate types. Created a binding_type_exception which is thrown when a bind attempt fails due to mismatched types [Aaron Giles]:
  * Added helper templates to driver_device to wrap legacy device read/write handlers into driver_device member functions. This should help move some things forward until more common code is converted into proper devices.
  * Introduce new module devcb2 which contains modernized versions of devcb. Compared to previous implementation this one is simpler overall, trampolining calls through a single internal set of adapter functions. The new versions are also designed to be specified in the machine_config rather than in structures, so they are no longer simple POD types. Additional new/changed features:
  * Reads and writes can map to delegates for line or 8/16/32/64-bit.
  * Reads and writes can map to an I/O port.
  * Reads can be mapped to a constant value, with or without logging.
  * Writes can be mapped to a device's input line.
  * All reads/writes can have a shift, mask, and/or xor applied.
  * Devices can opt to make the functions safe-if-NULL when resolving.
  * Only member function types are supported.
  * Rewrote the YM2151 interface to be fully modernized, and removed the ym2151_interface struct in favor of inline configs using the new devcb2 mechanism. In many cases, removed no longer needed trampolines, instead taking advantage of direct support for input line writes.
- Switched SCSICB to use DEVCB2 [smf].
- Optimized the PLA implementation and added simple caching with significant performance increase [Curt Coder].
- tlcs900.c: Implemented the 4-byte prefetch queue [Wilbert Pol].
- t6w28.c: Converted to C++ [Wilbert Pol].
- suna8.c update [Luca Elia]:
  * Emulated the protection in sparkman.
  * Support for two sprite chips.
  * Support for two sample ROMs.
  * Fixed color cycling in hardhea2.
  * Per-game tile banking.
- Added opcodes to Atmel AVR core: OR, SBCI, ORI, ST Y+, ADIW [Mooglyguy].
- Fixed functional issues in Atmel AVR opcodes: COM, NEG, LSR [Mooglyguy].
- Hooked up polepos.c, portrait.c and tomcat.c to use the new tms5220 implementation [Osso].
- addrmap: Yes, we can have a map for 8bits on 8bits, and that's not the end of the world [O. Galibert].
- addrmap: Avoid a collision between address_map the type and the method of the device_memory_interface class [O. Galibert].
- i386: 486+ WP bit support [Carl].
- Williams system3: 'Contact' and 'Disco Fever' marked as WORKING [Robbbert].
- Hot Tip, Lucky Seven: Added chimes, now marked as WORKING [Robbbert].
- Moved 'Phoenix' and 'Pokerino' to s3.c and marked as WORKING [Robbbert].
- Don't crash on REP NOP [Carl, Alegend45].
- suna16.c: Emulate protection routines rather than patching them for uballoon [IQ_132 & JackC].
- pgm.c: Fix level 6 crash on kov  [IQ_132].
- megadrvb.c: simplify decode function for srmdb [IQ_132].
- Cleaned up mustache boy vblank interrupts: Got rid of the nasty long-int hack in mustache boy in favor of the same 'vblank in+vblank out' int scheme the other similar seibu games of this era used (panicrd, darkmist). This seems much more likely to be what the actual PCB used, and works just fine. [Lord Nightmare].
- Changed 2 disc hack to use 1 drive [smf].
- SCSICD now has a CDDA sub device [smf].
- avr8: Implemented MULS, ANDI, STD Z+, LD -Z, LD Y+, LD -Y, LD -X, SWAP, ASR, ROR, and SBIS opcodes [MooglyGuy].
- avr8: Moved Timer 0-2 into the CPU core itself, 30x driver speedup [MooglyGuy].
- Emulate protection in sf2rb, sf2rb2's (cps1.c) and ichirjbl (segac2.c) rather than simply patch it out [IQ_132].
- Hooked up PSX IRQ's using DEVCB2 [smf].
- avr8.c: Added LD Rd,Z+q opcode. Corrected cycle counts for LD and ST opcodes [MooglyGuy].
- avr8.c: Fixed a bug where a 2-cycle or 3-cycle opcode encountered during a time slice were causing all subsequent 1-cycle opcodes to deduct 2 or 3 cycles for the remainder of the time slice instead [MooglyGuy].
- Cleaned up the ide controller enough to change the irq to a DEVCB2 [smf].
- avr8.c: Fixed register indexing for MULSU opcode. Fixed register writeback for LD -Z and LD -Y opcodes [MooglyGuy].
- Bingo Mania: Added PCB layouts and descriptions [Roberto Fresca, Team Europe].
- ym2612: Fix LFO AM waveform [Eke-Eke, R. Belmont].
- Fun World driver improvements [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added 'Bonus Card (Austrian)' from Fun World.
  * Added PCB layouts.
  * Set Big Deal sets and Jolly Card hybrid as clones of Bonus Card.
  * Cleaned up the code.
  * Changed company name Funworld to Fun World.
  * Changed Mega Card to Power Card after check the real hardware running.
  * Fixed Power Card graphics ROM load.
  * Added technical notes.
- romload: Tell in which zips a missing ROM was searched for [O. Galibert].
- Moved jolycdat program to Bonus Card, making it parent. This program is a real original Bonus Card program, and the PCB was populated with common 'Jolly Card' graphics wrongly. The other 'Bonus Card' set was turned as clone, since has a fake copyright string (hack). Also added some technical notes [Roberto Fresca].
- More 'Fun World' driver improvements [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Renamed the internal layout artwork: bigdeal --> bonuscrd.
  * Default Bonus Card & Big Deal DIP switches positions, that allow boot the system without errors.
- Pennant Fever is now WORKING [Robbbert].
- lethalj.c: Added dipswitch locations to the 'Egg Venture' sets [Brian Troha].
- Improvements to Maygay M1 emulation, most games at least show something now [David Haywood, James Wallace].
- Remove hack patch for tdragonb and emulated protection instead [IQ_132].
- Comet is now WORKING [Robbbert].
- Magic Card II improvements [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added new Yugoslavian set of Magic Card 2 (Nov/New).
  * Added default NVRAM, needed to boot properly.
  * Rearrange the whole Magic Card 2 sets, and improved descriptions.
  * Added technical notes.
