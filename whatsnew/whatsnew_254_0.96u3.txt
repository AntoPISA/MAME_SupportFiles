Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed Wizz Quiz clone [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added shadow effects to the SSV driver [Luca Elia].
- Simplified additive path in slapstic code. This should not impact any games that use it, but it is worth verifying [Aaron Giles].
- Improvements to The Couples driver: Improved the video hardware, added a preliminary PPI8255 + inputs interface, added a better workaround of the $b011 jump, and added sound. Now the game is somewhat playable, but there are still some problems in the game [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed DIP switches in several games [Brian Troha]:
  * Dream Soccer '94
  * Major Title
  * Seibu Cup Soccer
  * Caveman Ninja (World & US)
  * Spinal Breakers
  * Play Girl 2
  * Rohga
  * Shootout
- Added 'find' command to the new debugger for performing memory searches [Aaron Giles].
- Adjusted sound balance in a few drivers [David Haywood].
- Added preliminary video emulation to penocup.c [David Haywood].
- Added better debugging support to the the MIPS and PPC cores [Nathan Woods].
- Improved sound in Hot Shock and Explorer [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Hooked up light gun properly in Golgo 13 [R. Belmont].
- Fixed sprites, controls, colors, sound, many graphics problems in Panic Road, but still not working [Tomasz Slanina].
- Fixed TMS34010 reverse blitters so they didn't perform extraneous source memory fetches [Aaron Giles].
- Old debugger no longer forces the memory display to 16-bit words regardless of the size specified with the M command [Andrew Church].
- Fixed OKI sample rate in Dark Seal/Crude Buster. Attempted to fix Vapor Trail dropped sound commands [Bryan McPhail].
- Changed trace and traceover commands so they can append to existing files by placing '>>' before the filename [Nathan Woods].
