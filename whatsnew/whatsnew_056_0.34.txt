NeoGeo Support
--------------
- You need a zip file called neogeo.zip in your rompath.  It should contain at least three files:

neo-geo.rom (128k)
ng-sfix.rom (128k)
ng-sm1.rom (128k)

Important! The bios zip file must be called neogeo.zip NOT neo-geo.zip, ie, here should be no dash in the middle.

- You also need to place the game zip in your rompath.  If you do not know what 8 character filename the NeoGeo game you want to play has you can type:

mame -listclones neogeo

That will list the 8 character zip names of all currently supported games.

- Optional ROM loading of samples:  You may find games that do not work now due to lack of memory as all the sound roms need to be loaded. Some games will require an extra 16 megabytes of memory to load the sound roms. You can force Mame NOT to load these samples if you specify no sound BEFORE ROM loading takes place. In Dos this means you must type: 

  mame game -soundcard 0

  If you DO NOT specify soundcard 0 then all sound roms will be loaded and you may experience memory problems.
- All games work, both in arcade and home mode. If you are stuck with a copyright message or the coin inputs don't work, delete the .CFG and .HI file for that game. This will fix the problem. Super Sidekicks controls stop working after a couple of minutes, though.
- Sound support is 99% complete. If you experience garbled sound and you get NO GOOD DUMP EXISTS errors, this is caused by bad ROMs, not by imperfect emulation. There is NO WAY to fix that apart from redumping the bad ROMs.
- If you get a Z80 ERROR message, it means that the sound program ROM is bad. Run the game without sound.
- A few games have graphics glitches which are not easily fixed (raster line effects).
- "ROM length mismatch" errors. If you get these, and you are using ROMs larger than the ones MAME expects, then this is not a fatal error and the game will still run fine (provided the ROMs are good, of course). You can "fix" the ROMs yourself just by removing the second half of the file. Note that the sizes used by MAME are sort of arbitrary. In many cases it is difficult to know for sure which size the ROMs are really supposed to be, so we decided to consistently use the smallest possible files. The real ROMs *might* be larger than that, but the extra space is not used by the game - it is either all FF, or contains a verbatim copy of the first half.

- The music in Bubble Bobble stays in sync now [Tatsuyuki Satoh].


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------

Source changes:
--------------------
- *FINALLY* fixed Commando sometimes not starting. It was a bug in the decode routine, which has been completely rewritten [Nicola Salmoria].
- Chelnov is now playable! Plus many other fixes to the driver including slowdowns in Karnov [Bryan McPhail].
- Fixed Blasto [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Fixed ending in Robocop [JC Alexander].
- Fixed hang on level 7 of Discs of Tron [Jim Thevenot].
- Fixed movement of the squares in Checkman [Brad Oliver].
- Fixed resetting bug in Triple Punch [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed srumbler2 [Paul Leaman].
- Front Line and Tin Star have the aiming dial (using a dual joystick setup). Also, you can now kill and be killed in Front Line. However, collision detection is not accurately emulated [Nicola Salmoria].
- Improved Gladiator input handling [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Improved the System 16 drivers [Phil Stroffolino].
- Improvements to the System 8 driver [Nicola Salmoria].
- Replaced Front Line with the complete set containing the 68705 code. It still doesn't work though [Nicola Salmoria].
- Replaced Golden Star with the original, encrypted set [Mirko Buffoni].
- Several improvements and bug fixes to the Data East 68000 games ('Midnight Resistance', 'Bad Dudes', 'Robocop', etc.) [Bryan McPhail].
- The original Elevator Action now works, using the 68705 mcu ROM which was missing. Since there is one additional CPU to emulate, it is slower than the bootleg version [Nicola Salmoria].
- [DOS] New command -listcrc. It lists the CRC-32 for all the supported ROMs. 00000000 means that the ROM is known to be bad [Nicola Salmoria].
- [DOS] New -listinfo command to give details on all of the supported games [Andrea Mazzoleni].
- [DOS] New -romident option. Use "MAME -romident dirname" to identify unknown ROM sets.
- [DOS] Now using a new beta version of the SEAL audio library which further improves the dynamic range. You'll notice louder and better balanced sound in many games. Let me know about games with bad balance. The new library should also fix problems with the ENSONIQ AudioPCI and Creative PCI64 cards [Nicola Salmoria].
- [DOS] Profiler. To enable it, use the -profiler parameter; then, hit Left Shift + F11 to show the results on screen. The profiler REQUIRES the Pentium-class RDTSC instruction. It will not work on 486s, older Pentiums, and maybe other non-Intel CPUs [Nicola Salmoria].
- [DOS] Replaced the -fm option with -ym2203opl. Added -noym3812opl to use the digital emulation of the YM3812 instead of the SoundBlaster OPL chip. Note that with -noym3812opl you also need external drum samples [Nicola Salmoria].
- [DOS] Stereo sound support. It is a little slower than mono, to turn it off use -nostereo. Stereo is enabled only for games which really need it. The others always use mono.
- Clone sets are not reported as missing by -verifyroms if only the parent set is present [John Butler].
- Fixed a bug in the NOT instruction of the 68000 core [Mike Coates].
- Fixed bug in the 68000 interrupt handling which caused Rastan Saga to not boot correctly [Brad Oliver].
- Fixed bug in the Z80 emulator which caused crashes in Tapper and Tron [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Improved the user interface. Use "the key on the left of 1" (tilde on some leyboards) to turn on the On Screen Display which lets you change Volume, Gamma Correction, Brightess, and independently set the volume levels of the sound chips. Tab still brings up the setup menu, which is now asynchronous [Nicola Salmoria].
- Joystick calibration is available in the Tab menu [Bernd Wiebelt].
- Several changes to the cheat system, you'll have to download a new cheat database if you want to use it [Stephane Humbert].
- Switched to CRC-32 for file integrity checks. The old custom checksums are no longer used [John Butler, Bernd Wiebelt].
- Vector translucency can be turned off with -notranslucency [Valerio Verrando].
- When using the SoundBlaster OPL chip, YM3812 commands are converted to play at the correct frequency [Carl-Henrik Skrstedt].
- When using zipped files, ROMs are automatically retrieved even if they don't have the expected name (provided they have the correct CRC-32, of course). You'll never have to rename files any more (though you might have to rename zips ;-) [Nicola Salmoria].
- You can proceed from the "press OK to continue" screen by pushing left then right. You can also immediately quit by pressing ESC [Nicola Salmoria].
- [DOS] Rearranged the makefile using archives to work around E2BIG error on some machines [Juergen Buchmueller].
- A begginning for a YM2413 emulator. It pushes data through the YM3812 [Paul Leaman, Ernesto Corvi].
- Added memory_region_length field to the RunningMachine structure. This could be useful for drivers which handle several games on similar hardware [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed a bug in the 68000 BCD emulation which caused the F1 Dream timer to malfunction [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed bug in the I8039 external interrupt handling [Dan Boris].
- Fixed bug in the Z80 block I/O instructions (INI, IND, INIR, INDR, OUTI, OUTD, OTIR, and OTDR) [Frank Palazzolo].
- Fixed SBCD in M68000 disassembler [Mike Coates].
- I86 disassembler for the debugger, based on code by Robin Hilliard [Andrea Mazzoleni].
- Improved unzip code robustness when dealing with corrupt archives [John Butler].
- Moved the Sega encryption code used by 'Flicky', 'Future Spy', and many others, to machine/segacrpt.c [Nicola Salmoria].
- New field driver_init in the GameDriver structure. It's an optional function which can be used to do some game specific initialization, for example by adding memory handlers using the above functions [Nicola Salmoria].
- New file types for osd_fopen(): OSD_FILETYPE_STATE and OSD_FILETYPE_ARTWORK.
- New functions install_mem_read_handler() and install_mem_write_handler(). They can be used to install special memory handlers (for example, to trap busy loops, or to make small changes to the memory map for games running on similar hardware) [Alex Pasadyn].
- New streams.c to abstract audio streams. This makes them easier to use and more efficient. osd_play_streamed_sample() should now be considered a private function and should not be used in new code [Nicola Salmoria].
- New unzip interface. New zip directory cache and filename cache (the latter only in the DOS version) [Andrea Mazzoleni].
- Replaced the 6502 emulator with a new one which also supports 65C02 and 6510. Marat Fayzullin's core is no longer used [Juergen Buchmueller].
- TMS34010 emulator [Alex Pasadyn, Zsolt Vasvari].
- TMS9900 emulator [Andy Jones, based on original code by Ton Brouwer].
- x86 ASM 68000 core. This is a major speed improvement [Mike Coates, Darren Olafson].
- YM2610 emulator. This is used by the NeoGeo games [Hiromitsu Shioya].
- YM3812 and YM3526 software emulator. In the DOS version it is disabled by default because we are using the 100% compatible SoundBlaster OPL chip [Carl-Henrik Skrstedt].
