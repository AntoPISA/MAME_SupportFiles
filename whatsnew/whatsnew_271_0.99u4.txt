Source changes:
---------------
- Added memory card and cheat menus back into the system [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed MNG recording problem that was introduced in u3 [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed crash when running vector games that was introduced in u3 [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned up/normalized the naming of several core structures in an attempt to impose some order on coding conventions in the core code [Aaron Giles]:

  struct InputPortDefinition   -> input_port_default_entry
  struct InputPort             -> input_port_entry
  struct RegionInfo            -> region_info
  struct RunningMachine        -> running_machine
  struct GameOptions           -> global_options
  struct GameDriver            -> game_driver
  struct InternalMachineDriver -> machine_config
  struct MachineCPU            -> cpu_config
  struct MachineSoundRoute     -> sound_route
  struct MachineSound          -> sound_config
  struct MachineSpeaker        -> speaker_config
  struct RomModule             -> rom_entry
  struct SystemBios            -> bios_entry
  struct GfxLayout             -> gfx_layout
  struct GfxElement            -> gfx_element
  struct GfxDecodeInfo         -> gfx_decode

  Plus many others along the same lines (follow the pattern). Note that this work is not yet complete. In addition, a few of the more pervasive structs (mame_bitmap, rectangle) will be left until a non-diff release (0.100).
- Removed -skip_disclaimer since it automatically goes away after the first time execution [Aaron Giles].
- Created new NMK112 ROM banking module and connected it up to a number of drivers that made use of it. Affected games are in cave.c, nmk16.c, powerins.c, quizpani.c, toaplan2.c [Alex W. Jackson].
- Added missing buttons to Showdown [David Widel].
- Fixed the PULUW instruction on the 6309 disassembler [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed the state save facility play better on multisession ports if initialization fails [Tim Lindner].
