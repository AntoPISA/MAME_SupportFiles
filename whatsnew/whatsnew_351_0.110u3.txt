- Added ability for options_add_entries() to override defaults specified in the core. To do this, simply include an option in the list with the same name as the core option and provide a new default. This default will override the one specified in the core [Aaron Giles].
- Added hooks to chd.c to specify codec-specific configuration info [Aaron Giles].
- Added new option -fontpath to control where the font files are loaded from [Aaron Giles].
- Added support for split CHD files. CHD files can be transparently split into multiple pieces and left that way during read access. Modifications to split files are always written to the last file. A new command chdman -split is now available to split an existing CHD file [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned up cdrom.c. Removed audio implementation and relocated code into sound/cdda.c. Changed metadata format to be textual instead of binary (old metadata format is still supported). Removed external access to CHD positions; all accesses are now done at the physical LBA level and converted internally [Aaron Giles].
- Enhanced chd.c to support hunk sizes up to 16MB, versus the previous 64k limit [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug in overflow handling and SUBC emulation in the TMS32010 core [Rainer Keuchel].

- Reverted Mario Bros. graphics offset since it caused issues elsewhere [Derrick Renaud].
