Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed some DIP switches in bigrun and wildplt, and changed UK region to Europe in f1gpstar and f1gpstr2 [Sonikos].
- TIA-MC1 improvements [Eugene Sandulenko]:
  * More documentation.
  * Fixed inputs.
  * Fixed video framerate and VSYNC delay.
  * Adjusted CPU freq according to documentation.
  * Removed hack with off-board video RAM.
  * Implemented sound.
  * Added NO_DUMP PROMs.
- Improved documentation in the asteroids and tempest drivers [Brian Troha].

- Added missing DIP switch to Hangman driver [Wolfi].
- Added a callback to the 68000 emulator for the TAS instruction, which allows different implementations based on external hardware [David Haywood].
