- Implemented I2C accesses to the Acorn Archimedes / Aristocrat MK-5 HW, fixing SRAM check [Angelo Salese].
- Added clock read-back register to the I2C device [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed the Sound DMA in Acorn Archimedes / Aristocrat MK-5, adding sound support to the drivers [Angelo Salese].
- Add IC pinout to VLM5030 driver. Still need translation of the datasheet for VCU, RST (which does more than just reset) and MTE. [Lord Nightmare].

- Rewritten I/O device r/w accesses in Acorn Archimedes/Aristocrat MK-5 [Angelo Salese].
- Added missing save-state registration entries to the SH-2 core [Phil Bennett].
- Converted address_space to a class, and moved most members behind accessor methods, apart from space->machine and space->cpu. Removed external references to 8le/8be/16le/16be/32le/32be/64le/64be. All external access is now done via virtual functions read_byte()/read_word()/etc. Moved differentiation between the endianness and the bus width internal to memory.c, and also added a new axis to support small/large address spaces, which allows for faster lookups on spaces smaller than 18 bits [Aaron Giles].
- Provided methods for most global memory operations within the new address_space class. Updated callers to use these instead of the old global functions [Aaron Giles].
- Created new module delegate.h which implements C++ delegates in a form that works for MAME. Details are in the opening comment. Delegates allow member functions of certain classes to be used as callbacks, which will hopefully be the beginning of the end of fetching the driver_data field in most callbacks. All classes that host delegates must derive from bindable_object. Today, all devices and driver_data do implicitly via their base class [Aaron Giles].
- Added an alternate set of address map macros. Now, if you #define ADDRESS_MAP_MODERN prior to #including "emu.h", you will get the new macros, which have the following properties [Aaron Giles]:
  * ADDRESS_MAP_START takes a 4th parameter, which is the name of the driver_data class the other macros will reference;
  * AM_READ/AM_WRITE/etc. all assume you are providing method names off of the driver_data class you originally specified;
  * AM_READ_LEGACY/AM_WRITE_LEGACY macros are provided for calling global static functions of yore;
  * AM_BASE/AM_SIZE all assume you are providing member names off of the driver_Data class;
  * AM_BASE_LEGACY/AM_SIZE_LEGACY are provided to reference globals if necessary.
- Defined delegates for read/write handlers. The new delegates are always passed an address_space reference, along with offset, data, and mask. Delegates can refer to methods either in the driver_data class or in a device class. To specify a delegate in an address map, you must #define ADDRESS_MAP_MODERN before including emu.h, at which point the AM_READ/AM_WRITE macros will require member function pointers into your driver_data class. Delegates that are specified in an address map are proto-delegates which have no object; they are bound to their object when the corresponding address_space is created [Aaron Giles].
- Added machine->m_nonspecific_space which can be passed as the required address_space parameter to the new read/write methods in legacy situations where the space is not provided. Eventually this can go away but we will need it for a while yet [Aaron Giles].
- Added methods to the new address_space class to dynamically install delegates just like you can dynamically install handlers today. Delegates installed this way must be pre-bound to their object [Aaron Giles].
- Moved beathead's read/write handlers into members of beathead_state as an example of using the new delegates. This provides examples of both static (via an address_map) and dynamic (via install_handler calls) mapping using delegates. [Aaron Giles].
- Changed the DIRECT_UPDATE_CALLBACKs into delegates as well. Updated all users to the new function format. Added methods on direct_read_data for configuring the parameters in a standard way to make the implementation clearer. Updated all users [Aaron Giles].
- Created a simple_list template container class for managing the common singly-linked lists we use all over in the project [Aaron Giles].
- Replaced "const address_space" with "address_space" throughout the system. The purpose of making it const before was to discourage direct tampering, but private/protected does a better job of that anyhow and it is annoying now [Aaron Giles].
- neodrvr.c updates [Johnboy]:
  * Renamed the following sets: (sengokh) to (sengokuh), (fatfursa) to (fatfurspa), (shocktra) to (shocktroa), (kof99) to (kof99h) and (kof99a) to (kof9);
  * Removed wh2j (only diff. C-ROM arrangement; same data);
  * Added correct m1 to sengoku;
  * Corrected ROM_REGION "maincpu" for twinspri, ghostlop, aof2, aof2a, fightfev, fightfeva;
  * Added correct p1 ROM to irrmaze.
- Changed GP9001 (toaplan VDP device) to use DEVICE_SELF [David Haywood].
- Added 3 Bags Full - 5VXFC790 (Victorian). Set is now parent. Replaced the bad dumped GFX from NZ set with the new ones, since they match 4 of 6 bitplanes [Roberto Fresca].
- Improvements to calomega.c driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added Game 24.0 (Gaming Draw Poker, hold). The game is playable;
  * Added missing 50/60Hz output frequency selector to systems 903-905. However, I dunno how it looks physically (switch/jumper/bridge?);
  * Injected missing start and NMI vectors to comg080 (Arcade Black Jack), from an exhaustive program ROM analysis / reverse engineering. The game now starts ok and is triggering proper NMI's;
  * Inputs from the scratch for comg080 (Arcade Black Jack);
  * Added workaround to pass the vector-check protection;

  * machine_start, machine_reset;
  * sound_start, sound_reset;
  * palette_init, video_start, video_reset, video_update, video_eof.
- The default implementations of these call through the machine configuration's functions as before. However, if a driver_data_t overrides them, it will be called instead [Aaron Giles].
- Also added virtual functions for pre_save() and post_load(), which can be overridden to implement machine driver-specific pre-save/post-load functionality instead of registering with the save state system [Aaron Giles].
- Updated beathead to use these new virtual functions instead of specifying callbacks in the MACHINE_DRIVER [Aaron Giles].

- naomi.c: Added information about the Namco MASK B-F2X cartridge [f205v].
- Improved sound in Erotictac/Poizone [Angelo Salese, Phil Bennett].
- De-converted MACHINE_DRIVER from tokens back to constructor functions, regaining type safety. If legacy devices still use inline data, those types are not checked. However, new devices no longer have access to the generic m_inline_data. Instead their MDRV_* macros should map to calls to static functions in the device config class which downcast a generic device_config to the specific device config, and then set the appropriate values. This is not to be done inline in order to prevent further code bloat in the constructors. See eeprom/7474/i2cmem/okim6295 for examples [Aaron Giles].
