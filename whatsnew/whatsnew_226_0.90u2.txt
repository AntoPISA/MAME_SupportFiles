New Game/Clone Supported or Promoted from GAME_NOT_WORKING Status
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Winning Spike (EAA version) [Fabrice Arzeno] (1)

Note:
-----
(1): Maybe others as some of the Model 3 games such as vs215 work quite well.


Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed colours in Battle City [Roberto Gandola].
- Slight change to the Arcadia driver: Refactors code specific to the Arcadia arcade system and the Amiga computer out of src/machine/amiga.c into callbacks. This allowed me to get rid of all #ifdef MESS code out of src/machine/amiga.c [Nathan Woods].
- ST-V updates [Angelo Salese]:
  * Fixed a bug with the VDP-1 RAM reading, SH-2 can do byte or word access, it's implicit that can't do long word access. This fixes the Steep Slope Sliders booting so the game now works;
  * VDP-1 PTM's "draw by request" was actually causing sprites to flicker in kiwames, reversed back to old implementation until I or somebody else understand what the current issue is (clear_framebuffer?);
  * Finished the game header update,let me know if you like/don't like the system used for the description of the games;
  * Fixed a ST-V visible area incorrectness which was causing Virtual Mahjong 2 to crash after the sound RAM check;
  * Fixed a window effect bug in Double-density interlace mode,this fixes some graphics in (vmahjong) and (myfairld);
  * Guessed a bitmap positioning issue in double-density interlace mode,this fixes the NBG1 positioning in myfairld;
  * My Fair Lady now works but only with sound disabled.I have not removed the NOT_WORKING status due to that.
- New sound functionality [Derrick Renaud]:
  * Took Frank Palazzolo's DISCRETE_FILTER2 code and made it work outside of the discrete system. See sound\filter.h for new functions. Added op-amp bandpass filtering circuit to sound\namco54.c;
  * Game sriver changes: bosco, galaga, polepos, xevious - added proper filters to new Namco54 noise source.
- Fixed Priority bug in Kid Niki and fixed crash on last level [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed priority in Lot Lot [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Decrypted 'Sukeban Jansi Ryuko' [Nicola Salmoria].
- ARM7 CPU core [Steve Ellenoff].
- G65816 CPU core patch: Cleaned up the code a bit; make some functions static and added step over/out support to the disassembler [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed 6809dasm.c compile warning [Hans de Goede].
- Model 3 Updates [Ville Linde]:
  - PowerPC core: 
  * Better interrupt handling. Nested interrupts work properly;
  * Some support for PPC602;
  * Major bugfixes;
  * Added some unimplemented opcodes.
  - 53c810 SCSI:
  * Fixed single-stepping mode DMA;
  * Added memory moves and DMA callback.
  - Model 3:
  * Added Epson RTC-72421 emulation;
  * Preliminary polygon emulation;
  * Preliminary (not working yet) sound emulation;
  * Too much to list :) Most Step 1.x games show something now, up to and including full 3D.
- Fixed multiple port recording [Chad Hurwitz].
- Fixed several compile warnings [Lawrence Gold].
- Upgraded to zlib 1.2.2 [Santeri Saarimaa].
- Added unused proms to Crystal Castles [Santeri Saarimaa].
