Source changes:
---------------
- Changed -listxml to accept a wildcard gamename like most other frontend options to limit which games are output [Aaron Giles, Buddabing].
- More generic 6840 module improvements [El Condor].
- Moved MESS-specific Atari FDC code into a MESS specific file, in addition to fixing bugs [Nathan Woods].
- Updated the "Psikyo4' and 'Backfire' drivers to support multiple screens [David Haywood].
- Moved some common code into taito_en.c (taito ensoniq sound system) [David Haywood].
- Added 16-bit color support for the DirectDraw renderer (only used if switchres is off or in a window). Fixed 16-bit line rendering in the software rasterizer [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed ddraw bug where switching views sometimes didn't clear out the edges of the screen [Aaron Giles].
- The UI is now limited to a single screen [Aaron Giles].
- Reimplemented the palette/graphics/tilemap viewer. It is still connected to F4, but works differently. To switch between modes, press the ENTER key. Here are the new keys in each mode:
  * Palette/colortable mode:
    [ ] - switch between palette and colortable modes.
    up/down - scroll up/down one line at a time.
    pgup/pgdn - scroll up/down one page at a time.
    home/end - move to top/bottom of list
    enter - switch to graphics viewer.
  * Graphics mode:
    [ ] - switch between different graphics sets.
    up/down - scroll up/down one line at a time.
    pgup/pgdn - scroll up/down one page at a time.
    home/end - move to top/bottom of list.
    left/right - change color displayed
    r - rotate tiles 90 degrees clockwise.
    - + - increase/decrease the number of tiles displayed per row.
    enter - switch to tilemap viewer.
   * Tilemap mode:
    [ ] - switch between different tilemaps.
    up/down/left/right - scroll 8 pixels at a time.
    shift+up/down/left/right - scroll 1 pixel at a time.
    control+up/down/left/right - scroll 64 pixels at a time.
    r - rotate tilemap view 90 degrees clockwise.
    - + - increase/decrease the zoom factor.
    enter - switch to palette/colortable mode.
- Note that both graphics and tilemap modes only display data at an integral scale factor so you are limited based on the resolution of your render target. For -video ddraw, you can get more pixels by using -prescale to scale the screen. For -video d3d, the render target is at your screen's native resolution already [Aaron Giles].
- Improved scaling calculations when running with -video ddraw and no hardware stretch to better approximate the real aspect ratio [Aaron Giles].
- Added more internal texture reference tracking to ensure that stale data is not being referenced if the OSD layer holds onto a render list [Aaron Giles].
- Moved cygwin-specific compiler options to windows.mak [Aaron Giles].
- Removed screen aspect ratio specification from the machine driver. This information is now provided by the render/view system. Games with odd aspect ratios should include a game-specific layout to position the screens [Aaron Giles].
- Screenshots are now properly rotated again. Also, MAME now saves one screenshot per visible screen for multi-screen games (i.e., cyberbal will write two PNGs per snapshot taken if both screens are visible) [Aaron Giles].
- Changed the way built-in layouts are handled. There is now a new layout directory in the source which contains actual .lay files. These are converted at compile time into .lh files which are  #included by various drivers and then referenced. The built-in set of horizontal, vertical, and dual screen layouts are also handled this way now instead of being dynamically generated. In order to support things like "native" aspect ratios, a limited form of  variable substitution is now done on most of the XML attributes when they are read [Aaron Giles].
- Improved default layout selection. For multiscreen games on a single monitor, the default layout will show all screens at the same time. For multiscreen games on multiple monitors, the default layouts will select one screen per game [Aaron Giles].
- Converted the punchout driver to a proper dual screen game. Rewrote the video portion to use tilemaps [Aaron Giles].
- Added dual screen support to the PlayChoice 10 and vsnes drivers [Aaron Giles].
- Added MDRV_DEFAULT_LAYOUT to specify a default layout at the machine driver level [Aaron Giles].
- Added triple screen support to the Darius and Ninja Warriors drivers, and dual screen support to the Warrior Blade driver [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed palette for games which were using palette_set_brightness [Aaron Giles].
- Changed logic so that trying to run more screens than you physically have in full screen mode will just display as many as will fit rather than fighting to put multiple full screen displays on a single monitor [Aaron Giles].
- Added optimizations to figure out the minimal set of screen areas to clear, even with complicated views and multiple screens [Aaron Giles].
