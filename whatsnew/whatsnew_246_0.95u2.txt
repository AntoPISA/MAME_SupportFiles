Source changes:
---------------
- Incredible Tech. 8-bit update [Aaron Giles]:
  * Added extensive documentation on all the various PCB layouts.
  * Reorganized drivers to match PCB information.
  * Fixed paging/flicker problems in 'Poker Dice/Dyno Bop'.
  * Fixed lack of announcer voices in Rim 'Rockin' Basketball' (rimrockn057gre).
  * Fixed P3/P4 controls in Rim Rockin' Basketball.
  * Added "behind the beam" updating for 'Super Strike Bowling'.
  * Redid Slick Shot input to use a crosshair for starting point and trackball movement for velocity.
  * Hooked up inputs for 'Dyno Bop'/'Super Strike Bowling', which are now somewhat playable.
  * Rewrote blitter implementation to be much simpler (no more macros).
  * Measured and implemented accurate blitter timing (fixes some speed problems).
  * Cleaned up TMS34061 implementation to remove dirty pixel tracking.
  * Fixed scanline computations in TMS34061 code.
  * Updated 'Capcom Bowling' driver as well to handle TMS34061 changes.
- Sega ST-V update [Angelo Salese]:
  * Fixed 'Batman Forever' ROM loading,now the game works, thanks to Runik to point this out.
  * Fixed some interrupt issues because the old implementation was giving several hangs on the above game.To be more specific added the sprite draw end irq to the INTERRUPT_GEN structure & fixed a bug which prevented the vblank bit to not be cleared if the irq mask has the VBLANK-IN disactivated.
  * Fixed the NMI_disable/enable cmds on the SMPC device,his function is to active/disactive a bit in the SMPC ram.This fixes the "2 credits bug at start-up" in 'Shanghai Triple Threat'.
  * Fixed a bug in the bitmap type 4 in VDP2 handling,which was causing the Sunsoft logo in 'Shanghai Triple Threat" to not show correctly.

- Attempted to fix crash in 'Crackdown' [David Haywood].
- Misc patch [Nathan Woods]:
  - src/cpu/m6502/m6502.c:

  - src/machine/6821pia.c:
  * PIA fix.
