New Non-Working Games / Clones Supported
----------------------------------------
Quiz Panicuru Fantasy [David Haywood] (9)

Notes:
------
(1): Some priority glitches, otherwise looks good.
(2): Mostly ok.
(3): Missing alpha effect on lens.
(4): Bad sprite colours, missing ground effects.
(5): Miscoloured sprites, background not correctly scaled.
(6): Missing ground in places.
(7): Missing ground in places.
(8): Hissing floors/ceilings there might be others too, a few can certainly be watched. This driver still needs a lot of work, I don't expect it to be completed soon due to the incredible complexity of this hardware.
(9): Haven't found any time for this in the last 6 months so included it anyway so it doesn't get lost, if anybody wants to finish it they're welcome.


Source changes:
---------------
- Several ST-V games are probably now playable, however be warned many are very very slow, this is not a bug, sound is still poor or non-existant in most titles, these haven't been tested for long so could easily fail at later levels. Games which were marked as working in previous updates are also improved (shienryu etc.) [David Haywood, Angelo Salese, Olivier Galibert]
- Rewrote rf5c68 sound core [Olivier Galibert].
- Misc Changes [Nathan Woods]:
  * Integrates some MESS specific fileio functionality (within #ifdef MESS);
  * Removing the update procedure in a MESS specific sound core.
- Some Hyperstone Fixes / Improvements (MooglyGuy].
- Fixed SCSP crash with -nosound [R. Belmont].
- Attempted to fix some hangs in the Soul Edge clones [smf].
- Added new function: activecpu_eat_cycles(cycles), needed for idle skipping in certain situations [Aaron Giles].
- Midway V-Unit Update [Aaron Giles]:
  * WarGods sound is 100% now;
  * Added some pre-initialization of the WarGods NVRAM;
  * Added speedup handlers for all games (it makes a little difference);
  * Revamped the DCS2 handling to support stereo output;
  * Fixed a number of synchronization issues in the DCS2 handling;
  * Implemented a few missing features in the Midway I/O ASIC.
- CPU Fixes / Tweaks [Aaron Giles]:
  - ADSP2100:
  * Fixed loading of 0 counters so they don't execute infinitely;
  * Fixed initial state of the SSTAT register.
  - MIPS3 (R4000/R5000):
  * Fixed timer handling so we don't set a timer too far in advance;
  * Changed timer handling so that the default. Compare value doesn't trigger timers;
  * Fixed cycle chomping to make sure we don't go over an interrupt boundary;
  * Added correct cycle times for MULT/DIV instructions;
  * Fixed display of the Count reigster in the debugger.
  - MIPS3DRC Same fixes as above, plus:
  * Fixed FP rounding glitches;
  * Now actually respecting the global FP rounding mode.
