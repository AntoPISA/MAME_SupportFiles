Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed colors in loverboy [David Haywood].
- Fixed buffer overflow in K054539 [BUT].
- SCSP improvements [kingshriek]:
  * Added logarithmic envelope table.
  * Set envelope level to start at 0x17f in the ATTACK state (0x3ff-0x280) as per Neill's notes.
  * Changed EG_SHIFT from 8 to 16 - more precision is needed to differentiate the longer decay envelope times.
  * In the DECAY1-->DECAY2 transition, changed the "<=" to "<".
  * Decreased the output of the effect out mixer a bit.
  * Fixed unaligned 16-bit samples.
  * Prevented keyoffs from killing slots when already in the release state.
  * Envelope steps in the attack state are apparently exponential. To account for this, I change the envelope output to linear for attacks.
  * Change the release rate calculation to use the decay table instead of the attack one.
- Fixed uninitialized variable in h6280 core [Wilbert Pol].
- Added meter support to the Cobra games. Cleaned up some of the steppers code [James Wallace].
- Const-ified a number of data structures in the MAME system [Atari Ace].
- Added PowerPC 604 processor support. Moved PowerPC opcode tables to the CPU context to allow multiple simultaneous processors with different opcode tables [Ville Linde].
- dkong driver updates [Couriersud]:
  * Added configuration switch to change palette between TKG02 (radarscp conversion) and TKG04 (dkong 2board).
  * Added speech support (samples) to radarsc1.
  * Fixed sound for drakton and strtheat.
  * Hooked up and written 8257 dma controller. All dkong and dkongjr based games now use the 8257. All epos and 2650 based games now use the 8257.
  * Fixed 2650 games to use dkong audio as well - only cpu replaced  by addon board.
  * Updated game flags and added missing ROM entries.
  * Traightened memory maps.
  * Fixed bug in dkong3b memory map
  * Externalized sound drivers to MACHINE_START in audio/dkong.c.
  * DAC Filter now uses lowpass sallen key filter.
  * Reorganized INPUT_PORTS.
  * Added Dip-Switch locations to 8ballact.
  * Fixed 8ballact according to conversion manual.
  * Reorganized code.
- Corrected a potential issue if more than one 8039/8035 is used by a driver. Also should fix a potential inconsistency between saving and loading a state [Couriersud].
- Added an assert to ensure that the sound clear latch value is only set at init time, since its value is not saved [Aaron Giles].
- Modified src2html to sort by filename rather than assuming that the OSD file finding routines would do so [Aaron Giles].
- Fix memory system regression caused by recent optimization. Fixed another bug uncovered as a result in the decrypted opcode management [Aaron Giles].
- More Zeus improvements. Converted over to 64-bit data and simplified the logic to work more like the hardware [Aaron Giles].
