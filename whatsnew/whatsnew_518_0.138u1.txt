- Documented and worked around a long standing level 3 protection fault in Pop Flamer [Angelo Salese].
- Rewritten palette initialization in Naughty Boy HW by using the RESNET [Angelo Salese].
- Rewrote Z180 cycle accounting to create a basis for more exact internal I/O and timer operations as well as implementing interrupt priorities. Removed unused BIG_SWITCH code as well [Couriersud].
- MPU4 Updates [James Wallace]:
  * Added trackball support.
  * Fixed quiz game controls.
  * Restructured AWP games' characteriser handling.
- Added photo y2k2 decryption table [iq132].
- Improved Z180 interrupt and timer handling. Added some missing save state entries and fixed HALT [Couriersud].
- Rewrote rom/ram banking. 20pacgal now supports save state [Couriersud].
- Added DIP LOCATIONS to Pengo, Jr. Pac-Man and clones [Tafoid].
- zaccaria.c: Improved sprite drawing, added DIP locations [hap].
- Ported Super Famicom Box from MESS to MAME [Angelo Salese].
- Modified the naomi clipping a bit to avoid so many black lines at the bottom [David Haywood].
- New Super 3D Golf Simulation - Waialae No Kiseki / Super Mahjong 2 (Super Famicom Box) [Angelo Salese].
- Removed Groove on Fight boot hack, not anymore needed [Angelo Salese].
- Added x/y boundary checking to ST-V bitmaps [Angelo Salese].
- atarigx2.c: More ROM name corrections as verified against a Moto Frenzy Mini Deluxe PCB. Added ROM for the "Clarn" game link sub PCB [Charles MacDonald, P. Sealy, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union].
- Added lfsr-driven starfield to 20pacgal. The general principle is understood now but star set selection and the star drawing condition are guesses [Couriersud].
- Moved global and static variables in driver galaga into a machine class. Renamed some variables, e.g. galaga_videoram and bosco_videoram to just videoram [Couriersud].

- Reverified TMS5200 clock and measured Vsync clocks from Zaccaria hardware [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Added debug_global_input_code_pressed_once() function to input.c [Angelo Salese].
- Added a readyq callback to the TMS5220 interface. This is needed to solve MT #3832. In zaccaria games, the intq and readyq are connected to pia 6821 lines ca2 and cb1 which are edge driven. Just reading readyq would miss to detect a state change if between reads readyq went 0-1-0. Updated zaccaria.c and looping.c. Fixes MT #3832 [Couriersud].
- Reworked rendering in toaplan2 to render tilemaps / sprites in a single pass, should be more accurate to hardware. Note, this further breaks the mixing in Batsugun and Dogyuun because the previous hacks can no longer work with the new rendering code. These games have been demoted to NOT_WORKING status until a better solution is found; they never worked properly anyway due to the extent of the video hacks needed to support them [David Haywood].

- Added NSC800 CPU emulation to the Z80 core [Sandro Ronco].
- Updated Legendary Wings with actual PCB speed readings [Corrado Tomaselli].

- Added bare-bones work around for the Network board in Super GT 24h and Over Rev, they now enters into attract mode [Angelo Salese].
- SDL: Fix compilation for GTK+ 2.20 and later [R. Belmont, Wingman]
