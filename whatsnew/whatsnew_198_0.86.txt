0.86 2004/08/23 [#198 - David Haywood]
--------------------------------------
While there are no new working games in this release it remains interesting from a technical and development point of view mainly due to the new PPC core as well as the Hyperstone and 37710 fixes. It should also be a fairly stable release after the many input changes which have taken place recently.


New Clones supported or promoted from GAME_NOT_WORKING status

Source changes:
---------------
- Various Konami PPC based games added: gticlub, gradius4, sscope, sscope2, racingj, racingj2, thrilld, midnrun, windheat. These are to demonstrate the PPC core in action, they contain only very preliminary emulation and do nothing more than display the initial test screens [Ville Linde].
- M37710, NamcoSS22 and C352 improvements [R. Belmont]:
  M37710 changes (m37710.diff):
  * Data bus is actually 16 bit, not 8.
  * Fixed saving of status register on interrupts.
  * Fixed errors in PHB, PHT, PLT, and ANDB opcodes.
  * Added XAB, PLB, and ROLB opcodes.
  * Fixed IRQ dispatch errors.
  * Various get_info fixes.
  - NamcoSS22 changes (s22.diff):
  * All CPU clocks changed to measured-by-Guru values.
  * Handle the changed M37710 bus width.
  * Temporarily disconnect shared RAM. 
  * There's a problem where the 68020's shared RAM test wipes out the 37710's work variables and causes it to crash. I 	suspect there's a register that halts or resets the 37710  Note: Prop Cycle has no POST and doesn't cause this problem, but all the other games do.
  - C352 change (c352.diff):
  * Remove debug printf that accidentally snuck in.
- SPI Improvements [Ville Linde]:
  * Improved (but not yet correct) tilemap decryption.
  * Preliminary sprite priority support.
- PowerPC 403 core [Ville Linde, Bart Trzynadlowski, Stefano Teso]:
  * This is basically SuperModel (Sega Model 3 emu)'s PPC core minus the FPU and 6xx-series specific instructions (that stuff isn't ported to MAME yet).  As such, it's passed all manner of synthetic PPC	torture tests and should be quite reliable for any	PPC403-based hardware.
- Virtua Racing improvements [Olivier Galibert, Andrew Gardner].
- Hyperstone CPU Core Improvements [Tomasz Slanina, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]:
  - Tomasz Slanina:
  * Interrputs after call and before frame are prohibited now.
  * Emulation of FCR register
  * Floating point opcodes (preliminary) .
  * Fixed stack addressing in RET/FRAME opcodes.
  * Fixed bug in SET_RS macro.
  * Fixed bug in return opcode (S flag)
  * Added C/N flags calculation in add/adc/addi/adds/addsi and some shift opcodes.
  * Added writeback to ROL.
  * Fixed ROL/SAR/SARD/SHR/SHRD/SHL/SHLD opcode decoding (Local/Global regs).
  * Fixed I and T flag in RET opcode.
  * Fixed XX/XM opcodes.
  * Fixed MOV opcode, when RD = PC.
  * Fixed execute_trap() .
  * Fixed ST opcodes, when when RS = SR.
  * Added interrupts.
  * Fixed I/O addressing.
  - Pierpaolo Prazzoli:
  * Fixed fetch.
  * Fixed decode of e132xs_xm opcode.
  * Fixed 7 bits difference number in FRAME / RET instructions.
  * Some debbugger fixes.
  * Added generic registers decode function.
  * Some other little fixes.
- Jaleco Mahjong Driver update [Angelo Salese]:
  * Some games are *almost* playable but still have protection issues.
  * Adjusted Top Speed volume balance.
- Misc fixes [Nathan Woods]:
  * Fixes PORT_INCLUDE by making the final IPT_END appended within input_port_allocate().
  * Added some MESS specific defaults.
  * Spelling fix in IPT_BILL default
- Fixed some Multisession win32 bugs [Chris Kirmse].
