- gime.cpp: Fixed handling of number of scan lines for legacy VDG/SAM modes on 'CoCo 3' [David Ladd, Tim Lindner].
- Initial work on next-generation machine configuration syntax [Vas Crabb]:
  * Made concrete device types callable and added support for device class constructor overloads.
  * Made machine_config aware of current device being configured and made finder/callback target tags apply relative to it.
  * Allowed devcb to be bound to a device/mix-in or the target of an object finder.
  * Allowed device finders to be used in place of literal tags in many places in machine configuration.
  * Replaced many MCFG_ macros with overloaded device constructors and removed many macros that provide limited value.
  * Removed implicit name mangling from macros for slot options, discrete sound descriptors, and graphics decode descriptors.
- Further improvements to NeoGeo experience [Vas Crabb]:
  * Moved arcade start buttons to controllers and allowed AES joystick to be selected on systems with D-sub connectors.
  * Changed kizuna4p and irrmaze to use a configuration more like MV-1B/MV-1C as earlier models lack support for SIT/FTC1B.
  * Made fixed software using mahjong panel default to Japan BIOS as European BIOS only supports joysticks in service mode.
  * Changed mahretsu to use JAMMA joystick panel as it doesnt support mahjong panel in MVS mode.
  * Allowed controls to be changed for MVS mahjong games (BIOS and bakatono support joysticks).
  * Gave the single-slot JAMMA variants parent/clone relationships.
