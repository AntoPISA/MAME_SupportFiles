Source changes:
---------------
New working clones
------------------
Tetris + Cherry Master (Corsica, v8.01, encrypted) [Ioannis Bampoulas]

-Reduced project cross-dependencies, slightly improved renaming script [Vas Crabb].

-Rearrange source to match project structure (done using the script in src/tools) [Vas Crabb].

-Eliminated cross dependencies between driver projects [Vas Crabb].
 * Driver projects now use globs to search for files.  There's less effort editing the Lua files when things are moved around.
    Remember it won't automatically pick up a change, so if you add/remove/change files, you should touch makefile to get it to find
    the change.
 * Driver projects no longer get the top-level MAME directory as an include path.  This means you need to think about how you
    structure things and not introduce nasty circular dependencies.
 * Subtarget projects can now be generated entirely from .flt files without the need for separate Lua scripts and .lst files.  This
    has been done for the arcade, mess and virtual targets.  It effectively works like a SOURCES= build on a large scale.  This
    means you need to organise things so the dependency genrators can find them.
 * There's an issue with the mess subtarget right now.  For some reason, decmate2.cpp isn't picking up the dependency on the PDP8
    CPU core for the HD6120 device.  I'll debug it later

-Converted nl subtarget to use a filter rather than a script and driver list [Vas Crabb].

-Add M68HC11 internal EEPROM for relevant models [AJR]

-bellybmbr: Fix ROM loading [AJR]

-Added make opions for filter file, adjusted source path display [Vas Crabb].
 * Added SOURCEFILTER option to specify a driver filter file in your make options, e.g. like make SUBTARGET=custom
    SOURCEFILTER=mydrivers.flt (or put it in your useroptions.mak if you'll be using it a lot).  It functions more-or-less like
    SOURCES on steroids.
 * Changed the way system/device source file paths are displayed to suit the new source layout better.  INI file loading hasn't
    changed, that still just uses the base file name.
 * Added overlooked trigger to src/bus.lua to include NES controller bus if the NES zapper sensor is needed.

-Prevent src/devices from inadvertently including headers from src/mame (#9996) [Miodrag Milanovi?]

-30test.cpp, skeetsht.cpp: Remove EEPROM areas from external maps [AJR]

-More quality of life features for new source layout [Vas Crabb]:
 * Added support for wildcards in .flt filter files.  You'll need to quote them to avoid /* being parsed as a comment initiator,
    like "seta/*.cpp" on a line including the quotes.
 * Added an XSLT filter for listing system driver sources, like mame -lx | xsltproc scripts/xslt/list-system-sources.xslt
 * Converted the ci subtarget (which isn't really used much) into a .flt rather than .lua and .lst files.

    devices with identically named memory views) causes a fatal error on start.
 * Fixed -aviwrite/-mngwrite with -snapview native more than two screens. Previously it would attempt to use the same file name for
    all screens but the first.
 * Improved naming of snapshots, especially when using -snapview native with -aviwrite/-mngwrite (see GitHub #10005).  The
    automatically included screen number should come before the extension if supplied. Also, assume that users actually know what
    they’re doing if they include a dot in a snapshot filename pattern.

 * Implemented more CRTC registers, getting to the point where System 6.0.8 and System 7.0.1 will show video on NTSC and PAL
    displays with approximately correct interrupt timings.  Also implemented 1:2:1 convolutions (this blurs the image vertically -
    in real life it reduces interlace flicker).
 * Screen update in interlaced modes isn't right yet - it updates every line on every frame, and there's a vertical offset caused by
    the initial half-line.

 * remove an identical clone set, game clearly boots as 'Atlantis' not Triple Dice'
 * fix a few more reel setups
 * allow m4madhse to boot based on AJR's research
 * m4matdr appears to be a 6 reel setup, this pushes it past the reel check to another error

-Fixing fs::cbmdos_image::enumerate_f() to properly look for single density (instead of double) (#10104) [npwoods]
 * This problem was identified because the file system didn't properly show up when the 'c64' driver was run, and this seems to be
    the correct fix.  The part of this that confuses me is that if this defect was preventing the CBMDOS fs from showing up under
    c64, why don't the CoCo file systems have the same problem?  Both fs_coco_rsdos.cpp and fs_coco_os9.cpp specify (seemingly
    incorrectly) SSDD.
