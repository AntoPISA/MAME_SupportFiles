Source changes:
---------------
- Redumped sprite ROMs in X Se Dae Quiz [Guru].
- Added preliminary (disabled by default) discrete sound emulation to Dai San Wakusei Meteor [Derrick Renaud, Andy Welburn].
- Added DMA slots to Legionnaire HW, fixes Godzilla regression [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed Bullet key back to what we dumped from original PCB [Aaron Giles].
- Improved sprite GFX ROM order in Godzilla [Angelo Salese].
- AY-3-8910 unused bits in registers read back as 0 [hap].
- Fixed Seibu logo tilemap colors in Seibu Cup Soccer [Angelo Salese].
- s3c24xx.c: Fixing compiling process on Linux and MacOSX [qmc2].
- Assigned MB88xx interrupt sources unique vectors, as expected by the Arabian MCU program [Phil Bennett].
- Hooked up Arabian MB8841 MCU and removed obsolete simulation code [Phil Bennett].
- Adjusted ym2203 clock speed and added XTAL for goindol.c based on a reference video recording [Tafoid, Rogerio].
- Rewrote ics2115 sound core using modern device standards, improving audio in Oriental Legend, Killing Blade and other PGM titles in the process [austere, nimitz, trap15].
- Implemented pdrawgfx for sprite routines in Legionnaire HW, and added wraparound for horizontal area smaller than 320, fixing left-border sprites in 'Legionnaire' and 'Heated Barrel' [David Haywood].
- Implemented a preliminary sort-DMA in Seibu COP routines, fixes sprite-sprite priorities in Seibu Cup Soccer [Angelo Salese].
- z80dart.c [Wilbert Pol]:
  * The channel B modified interrupt vector can be read immediately after setting it;
  * Reading from a read register other than 0 also masks out the register index.
- Fixed RAM fill in Seibu DMA COP command 0x116, allowing Godzilla to boot [Angelo Salese].
- Neo-Geo updates [Johnboy]:
  * burningfh - Renamed p1 to hp1;
  * gowcaizr - Added correct C8 ROM;
  * 8man: Tagged MVS and AES version;
  * jockeygpa: Added alternate jockeygp set;
  * mslug5h: Corrected chip labels.
- Hooked up cocktail mode and proper controls for both players in Maze Invaders, adding button labels to describe the action of each [sxevious, Tafoid].
- Fixed LDM opcode register writeback in ARM CPU core [Tim Schuerewegen].
- General stability issues with 64-bit builds fixed for cybertnk.c [David Haywood].
- Implemented palette DMA brightness algorythm mode 5 in Seibu COP games, used by Seibu Cup Soccer, Godzilla, SD Gundam Rainbow Tairiku Senki and Legionnaire for fading effects [Angelo Salese].
- hvyunit.c: Hooked up Mermaid protection MCU and removed obsolete simulation code. Also updated the driver to use a state class [Phil Bennett, Dr. Decapitator, Andrew Gardner].
- Implemented preliminary road emulation in Cyber Tank [David Haywood].
- Renamed ilpag.c as blitz68k.c and added several games to the driver [Luca Elia].
- sdlmame now also looks for fonts in "-fontpath". In addition, moved font config stuff into function search_font_config. This is in preparation to add ttf support to windows sdlmame build [Couriersud].
- Fixed an ARM CPU core bug with pre-indexed addressing opcodes, that was preventing Poizone to boot [Tim Schuerewegen].
- Fix most-likely-to-fail SDL_TTF version check. Added a warning if strikethrough is specified but not supported [Couriersud].
- Reimplemented scatter-gather Sprite DMA in Seibu COP used by SD Gundam Rainbow Tairiku Senki, also improving the functionality in it [Angelo Salese].
- Greatly improved inputs and dip switches for ertictac.c [Tafoid].
- Fixed playfield color issues in Seibu Cup Soccer [David Haywood].
- Fixed *BSD compilation for SDLMAME [ElBarto].
- Fixed sfx in Chouji Meikyuu Legion [Tomasz Slanina].
- Implemented preliminary Seibu COP macro command 0xdde5, used by Seibu Cup Soccer x/y radar positions [Angelo Salese].
- Implemented ROM banking support in Raiden 2 HW, improving Raiden 2 and Zero Team behaviour [Olivier Galibert].
- plygonet.c: Fixed save state & device handler regressions [Andrew Gardner].
- Golden Poker driver: Added new sets, and some notes about ipc-1 daughterboard encryption [Roberto Fresca].
- Preliminary simulation of text layer protection in Chouji Meikyuu Legion [Tomasz Slanina].
- Further ICS2115 work [austere, nimitz, trap15].

- Adds the recent 87C52 MCU decaps to Wonder League Star and Wonder League '96 [Dr. Decapitator].
- superchs.c: Moved Button 6 assignment to a DIP selection which is more appropriate for "Freeze Screen" behavior and added some missing port names [Tafoid].
- Updated the RSP and RDP implementations to be largely bit-perfect and pixel-accurate [angrylion, Harmony].
- Fixed alpha compare in the N64 RDP implementation [Harmony].
- More Golden Poker driver cleanup. Added more references and reorganized some parent-clone relationship. Added some new sets [Roberto Fresca].
- Implemented Seibu COP macro 0x905, used for ark movements in Legionnaire / Zero Team when a knock down occurs [Angelo Salese].
- ARM7+ updates [Tim Schuerewegen]:
  * Enhanced MMU with page fault support;
  * Preliminary 26-bit mode support;
  * Fixed bugs with S-flag operations on R15;
  * Fixed STRH involving R15;
  * Support for ARM models 7500 and 920T.
- Add directxor parameter to direct memory accessors. Update all callers that manually XORed addresses to pass the XOR instead. This improves behavior when direct accessors hit non-RAM regions, or when watchpoints are used, because we now know the original, un-xored address and can fall back to standard read/write handlers properly. Also fixes glitched disassembly when read watchpoints are enabled [Aaron Giles].
- s3c24xx: Some improvements and fixes [Tim Schuerewegen].
- Removed public decodechar function [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed writes in the MIPS III interpreter [MooglyGuy].
- Some bulk naming cleanups across the whole source base [Aaron Giles]:

  MDRV_* -> MCFG_*
  running_device -> device_t
  mame_rand() -> machine->rand()
  memory_region() -> machine->region()->base()
  memory_region_length() -> machine->region()->bytes()
  region_info -> memory_region
