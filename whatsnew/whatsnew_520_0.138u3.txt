- Changed emualloc to free resource pools from earliest to latest so that early objects can safely clean up stuff they allocated [Aaron Giles].
- Changed device name from an overridable function to a parameter passed to the device_config constructor. In situations where the proper name is not known at construction time, a generic name can be specified and then overridden later once the configuration is complete [Aaron Giles].
- Decapped 89C51 MCU in Real Battle Mahjong King [Dr. Decapitator, Guru].
- metro.c: Added Puzzlet's MCU internal ROM. Zilog Z8 8-bit family MCU requires a new CPU core to be written [Dr. Decapitator].

 * Marked P1 in flipshot BAD_DUMP;
 * Identified kof98n as AES version; renamed (kof98n) to (kof98h).
- Improved v25 logging for Batsugun [David Haywood].
- igs011.c update [Luca Elia]:

  * Removed 149 ROM patches.
- Hooked up Slap Fight/Alcon 68705 MCU [Phil Bennett, Dr. Decapitator].
- Hooked up MCUs for Tough Turf (US) and Wrestle War; removed Wrestle War MCU simulation [Aaron Giles, Dr. Decapitator].
- cps2.c: Correct the release order for the Xmen: Cota (Hispanic) sets [gregf].
- Made the machine_config a proper object. Added detokenize method to this object which can be called multiple times to append new devices after the initial machine configuration is set up. Updated member variables to match new naming convention [Aaron Giles].
- Changed the running_machine to take a constructed machine_config object in the constructor, instead of creating one itself, for consistency. Also added machine->total_colors() as a shortcut to machine->config->m_total_colors [Aaron Giles].
- firetrap.c: Added PCB documentation, corrected ROM names, corrected clocks [Guru].
- idsoccer: Improved DIP locations, confirmed MSM5205 clock [Kevin Eshbach].
- Fixed title screen colors in Bogey Manor [Angelo Salese, Stefan Lindberg].
- Modified way device_type constants are defined in order to get unidasm compile [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Changed autmoon (aristmk4) romload to proper crc/sha hashes. The submitted romset contained a 32kb (u87.bin) which actually appeared to be an 8k overdumped [Tafoid].
- slapfght.c: Corrected ROM names for the Slap Fight sets and added PCB locations to any set where possible. Added Dipswitch locations to Slap Fight.  Moved PCB information down to matching ROM sets [Brian Troha, Guru].
- Split mame.c into mame.c and machine.c, the latter containing the running_machine definition and implementation [Aaron Giles].
- Moved global machine-level operations and accessors into methods on the running_machine class. For the most part, this doesn't affect drivers except for a few occasional bits [Aaron Giles]:

  mame_get_phase() == machine->phase() 
  add_reset_callback() == machine->add_notifier(MACHINE_NOTIFY_RESET, ...) 
  add_exit_callback() == machine->add_notifier(MACHINE_NOTIFY_EXIT, ...)
  mame_get_base_datetime() == machine->base_datetime()
  mame_get_current_datetime() == machine->current_datetime()
- Cleaned up the region_info class, removing most global region accessors except for memory_region() and memory_region_length(). Again, this doesn't generally affect drivers [Aaron Giles].
- Resurrect the old sampling profiler, and improve it to be useful [Aaron Giles]:
  * Always available now, just specify -profile <n> to enable it;
  * Supports stack walking to uniquely identify call chains; the <n> parameter to the -profile option specifies how deep to go;
  * Automatically turns off throttling and multithreading, and sets the number of processors available to 1 (since we only sample the main thread);
  * Output now uses the common symbol lookup, which actually uses the PDB for MSVC builds and sym files for gcc builds;
  * The top 30 unique call chains are output.
- Fix performance regression for PowerPC games. The timing made heavy use of cpu_get_total_cycles() which is now slow. Better to use the legacy_cpu_device directly and call device->total_cycles() which avoids the dynamic_cast to find the execute interface from a generic device [Aaron Giles].
- Added cycles_to_attotime() and attotime_to_cycles() which is more often what is requested (clocks are the raw input clock, while cycles are internal clock after dividers/multipliers) [Aaron Giles].
- Removed most other instances of cpu_get_total_cycles [Aaron Giles].
- Removed the following functions [Aaron Giles]:

  cpu_get_total_cycles()   == cpudevice->total_cycles()
  cpu_clocks_to_attotime() == cpudevice->cycles_to_attotime()
  cpu_attotime_to_clocks() == cpudevice->attotime_to_cycles()

- Correct DIP switch location order in World Rally to match actual DIPs as seen by the game / service menu [Brian Troha].
- namcos22.c: Updated ridgerac, raveracw and acedrvrw to use keys instead of DIP switches for shifters [Fabio Priuli].
- Added COPX romloading for sets that didn't have it, marked as BAD_DUMP until the assumption that they're the same is (un)confirmed [hap].
- Winmain cleanup [Aaron Giles]:
  * Created dynamic_bind<> template class to handle dynamically binding to optionally-supported functions;
  * Wrapped stack walking code in a class;
  * Wrapped symbol lookup code in a class;
  * Added support for parsing objdump-produced symbol dumps which include non-global functions for much better stack dumps and profiling in gcc builds.
- Modified makefile for win32 targets to automatically run objdump and produce a .sym file if SYMBOLS is enabled [Aaron Giles].
- Update cheat loading to support image devices (moved implementation from MESS), use only CRC of first found image [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Removed cpu_get_sp() [Aaron Giles].
- Added overrides to fetch the execute, memory and state interfaces without doing a dynamic_cast<> to speed up common legacy operations [Aaron Giles].
- Created CPU-specific device types for all CPUs, using new macros DECLARE_LEGACY_CPU_DEVICE and DEFINE_LEGACY_CPU_DEVICE. Changed CPUs to be their own device types, rather than all of type CPU with a special internal subtype. Note that as part of this process I removed the CPU_ prefix from the ALL-CAPS device name, so CPU_Z80 is just plain old Z80 now. This required changing a couple of names like 8080 to I8080 so that there was an alphabetic first character [Aaron Giles].
- Hooked up Heavy Barrel I8751 MCU [Bryan McPhail, Dr. Decapitator].
- cb2001: Added 2 new opcodes [robiza].
- Hooked up Gondomania I8751 MCU [Bryan McPhail, Dr. Decapitator].
- Reimplemented Meikyuu Hunter G I8751 MCU according to schematics [Bryan McPhail].
- Software list update [Wilbert Pol]:
  * Software list xml files are now read in full such that information for clone and parent sets is available;
  * Added validity check to check for existence of parent sets.
- Imported image related utils from MESS into /lib/util [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Improved video emulation in cb2001 [David Haywood].
- Added support for Sega 317-5000 decryption (same as 315-5177). Reorganised decryption code [Nicola Salmoria].
- Moved debugging structure away from CPUs only and attached to all devices. Debugger now creates one for each device. C++-ified most debugger operations to hang off the debugging class, and updated most callers [Aaron Giles].
- Got rid of cpu_count, cpu_first, cpu_next, etc. as they were badly broken. Also removed cpu_is_executing, cpu_is_suspended, cpu_get_local_time, and cpu_abort_timeslice [Aaron Giles].
- Software list improvements [Miodrag Milanovic]:
  * Support for multiple software list per driver;
  * Added MDRV_SOFTWARE_LIST_COMPATIBLE_ADD for adding compatible software lists (for documentation purposes);
  * listsoftware option now return only original software lists;
  * UI is updated to enable mounting software items per device, it will display only items from list that are for specific device;
  * Separate compatible software lists in UI.
