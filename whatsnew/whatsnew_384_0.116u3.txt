Source changes:
---------------
- Simplified CPS3 decryption function [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed potential double free in PNG code [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed warnings generated by newer gcc compilers [R. Belmont].

General driver cleanups: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - changed some more global ‘Machine’ to local ‘machine’
 - standardized on the function name ‘draw_sprites’
 - removed some antiquated boilerplate comments

Updated FM emulator to use mame_time instead of double. Removed old
neogeo hack from FM code as it appears to no longer be necessary.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Updated all sound cores to use mame_time instead of double.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Populated several more Irem CPU opcodes for gussun. [robiza]

Fixed CPS3 code to work on big-endian systems [R. Belmont].

Fixed code_to_token() to prevent potential buffer overflows.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed crashes in non-working drivers dynablsb and driveyes.
[Atari Ace]

Changed all CPU cores’ internal timers to the mame_timer* functions 
as well as the remaining couple of core files that still used 
timer_alloc(). After this, none of the emu/* files have any old style 
timing code left. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Various CPS3 updates as documented on Haze's blog [David Haywood].

Fixed type in BLENDER2_32 function in the n64 video code.
[Christophe Jaillet]

Created a new resistor network interface for computing palettes from
color PROMs and component values on the PCB. Fixed several issues
with the previous implementation. [Couriersud]

Donkey Kong driver update: [Couriersud]
 - added sprite RAM bank switching from schematics
 - combined memory maps
 - first attempts on decoding m58815
 - radarsc1 driver for radarscope trs01 hardware
 - all drivers use VIDEO_RAW now
 - fixed cocktail issues
 - combined io and sound memory maps
 - implemented background handling (disable prom /CS line) in all 
    dkong drivers

- Extended the flt_rc filter to support highpass filtering. Fixed the lowpass filter to actually do a lowpass filter. Hooked up the filter to King & Balloon and updated several other drivers to the new interface [Couriersud].
- Added support in the main makefile for profiling. Set PROFILE=1 to turn this on. [Christophe Jaillet].
- Updated djboy driver to almost fully playable state [Phil Stroffolino].
- Temporarily reverted input code back to 0.116 baseline pending deeper analysis and upcoming core changes to simplify the OSD layer for input management [Aaron Giles].
- Changed a number of stderr fprintf's in the Windows OSD code to mame_printf_error and mame_printf_warning calls, as appropriate [Aaron Giles].
