Program changes:
----------------
- Added support for two versions of Pengo (one with the music of Popcorn and a clone) [Mirko Buffoni].
- After so much time of hard work the policy of "back to quality" is starting to bring back the efforts. I'm proud to announce I'v beated Mr Do's Castle. Done one, done all. So now we have also Mr Do! RunRun and Mr Do! Wild Ride. Thanks to the invaluable help of Nicola, they are also arcade colors perfect, very fast (!) and each game has audio support and hiscore saving! :D [Mirko Buffoni, Nicola Salmoria].
- Added sound support to Super Pac Man [Aaron Giles].
- And three... Aaron added support for Dig Dug! Hey man, you'r at a step to become a God of Arcade emulation ;) [Aaron Giles].
- Provided a better sound support for Phoenix. Melody is still missing, because Shaun's board doesn't have it [Andrew Scott].
- Provided me documentation for Yie Air Kung Fu. Also Phil sent me a more complete driver than mine for this game which is now playable [Enrique Sanchez, Philip Stroffolino].
- Fixed a bug in joystick redefinition menu. Also added the selection support for Any Button ("A" key), and None ("N" key) [Eric Anschuetz].
- Added a driver for 3 Stooges [Fabrice Frances].
- Fixed a bug that locked your PC if BLASTER variable was not found [Mirko Buffoni, James Oliver].
- Fixed 'Commando' dip switch bonus settings. Also fixed a setting in Ant Eater DIP switch [Mirko Buffoni].
- Have added support for 'Mappy'. One of the most requested games. It was a pleasure working with Aaron! Healso added sound support and very close arcade colors (I think to have found the color_prom... if it's the correct prom it will be added in the next release). Hiscore saving is supported as well [Mirko Buffoni, Aaron Giles].
- Joined to the "back to quality" team. He added support for SeaWolf ][, and improved Space Zap and Gorf (which is still unplayable). Also Robby Roto is now fully playable (you'll need a bug free ROM set) [Mike Coates].
- Added hiscore saving to Ghosts 'n Goblins [Morten Eriksen].
- Nicola fixed Jump Bug driver which is now perfect. Colors are still wrong without proms [Nicola Salmoria].
- Did a great work adding trackball support to the main core system. Trackball is enable with -trak parameter. Trackball support has been added to Centipede and Reactor. Also, Patrick provided a driver for Crystal Castles. Great Work! ;) [Patrick Lawrence].
- Added support for Missile Command. I didn't include modifications for trackball for now. The code needs to be cleaned a bit, but the game is still playable [Ray Giarratana].
- Fixed sound tempo speed in Elevator Action (tempo speed is 37.5Khz) [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- Thanks to the outstanding combined efforts of Brad Oliver, Bernd Wiebelt and Allard Van Der Bas, MAME entered in vectorial emulation world! (YEAH!!!) All in a time, we have support for Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Black Widow, Battlezone, Gravitar, Lunar Lander, Red Baron, Spaceduel, Tempest!!! [Brad Oliver, Bernd Wiebelt and Allard Van Der Bas].
- Provided a new tweaked mode 256x232 for Crystal Castles. He also provided a new tweaked video mode to get vsynced 60Hz (perfect speed) with 256x256 games. It has horizontal clock recover (thus video is less mashed vertically, without having to modify monitor settings, and it doesn't be confused with 224x288 by monitors that remember settings. Really nice on scrolling games:  try it with "-noscanlines -vsync -vgafreq 1" [Valerio Verrando].


Sources changes:
----------------
- Introduced a new option (-dir4) that simplify the use of the joysticks to be connected on the keyboard. This modify resolves the problem of diagonal direction in games such as PacMan, Popeye, and Kung Fu Master [Mauro Minenna].
- Me, Nicola, Bernd and Patrick have heavily changed the main core set of sources. Improvements to speed, memory access, drivers structure were done. We strongly suggest to developers to start their code on a clean 0.26 version [Mirko Buffoni, Nicola Salmoria, Patrick Lawrence, Bernd Wiebelt].
- Opcode decode and graphic decode are now done by a single function in one step [Mirko Buffoni].
- Optimized DrawGfx() function in case TRANSPARENCY_PEN and TRANSPARENCY_COLOR without remap, producing a speed increment of 22-25% (try yourself with Elevator Action!) [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
