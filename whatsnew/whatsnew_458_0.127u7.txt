Source changes:
---------------
- Removed unneeded UI keys by removing the constants. Readded UI_ON_SCREEN_DISPLAY to be changed again in the "Inputs" menu [stephh].
- Added missing support of normal joystick for player 2 in 'gwarb' [stephh].
- Fixed a number of regressions due to recent 68000 IRQ changes [Aaron Giles].
- Added new functions for building device-relative tags. Changed machine configuration builder to use these functions. Also changed the laserdisc player devices to use them. Updated Z80 CTC/SIO code to assume that the CPU provided for the clock is relative to the device that the CTC/SIO belong to. Updated memory code to assume that regions and devices referenced by the memory map are relative to the device the associated CPU belongs to [Aaron Giles].
- Neo-Geo cleanups (still in progress) [Johnboy]:
  * Sorted OEM/Bootleg sets;
  * Renamed roms on non OEM/Bootleg sets to ONE naming sheme;
  * Renamed functions;
  * Added some comments.
- System 24 cleanups [Aaron Giles, Olivier Galibert]:
  * Correct memory map for both CPUs;
  * Reduced RAM size to 256k;

  * Renamed regions;
  * Proper interrupt handling;
  * Fixed dcclub magic latch.
- Checked, via Z80 code analysis, inputs and DIP Switches for the following games in snk.c driver: ikari, ikaria, ikarinc, ikarijp, ikarijpb, victroad, dogosoke, dogosokb, bermudat, bermudaj, worldwar, bermudaa, psychos and psychosj [stephh].
- Added correct overlay positioning, font, and behavior to PR-8210 emulation [Aaron Giles, Warren Ondras].

  * Added diverter function decoder;
  * Added full functional mechanical counters decoding;
  * Added 7 Segment decoder and 7 Digit Counter functions;
  * Added button-lamps layout & mechanical counters simulation on layout. Mechanical counters to layout: Coin-In, Coin-Out and Coin to Drop;

  * Added tower lamps to Baby Games layouts;
  * Reworked layouts for Baby Games.
- Fixed old regression bug in Sengoku Mahjong that made the controls not work when the V30 CPU core was converted to 16-bit. Specifically, the game accesses the multiplexer with a word write instead of a byte write [Angelo Salese].

- MCU protection now working for lohtb2 (m72.c) [Couriersud]:
  * Hooked up 6751;
  * Synchronized protection RAM writes with timer callbacks;
  * Removed speed hack from NEC CPU emulation, which breaks the protection code.
- snes.c: Fixed problem with OAM address reset at start of vblank [Tomasz Slanina].
