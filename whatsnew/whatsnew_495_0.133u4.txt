  * Fixed the x-offset for 32x32 tiles lines;
  * Fixed the screen aspect and visible area;
  * Confirmed correct colors. No bipolar PROM involved;
  * Added Noraut Joker Poker hardware and PCB layouts;

  * Created lamps layouts for 11 and 12-lamps scheme;
  * Rerouted some inputs to mantain the inputs layout;
  * Renamed some inputs to match the text with the real cab buttons;
  * Removed the imperfect colors flag from the existent sets;
  * Added 2 different control panel layouts to the source;
  * Updated technical notes.
- Fixed redundancy in clock speed assignments in some drivers by cleaning all divided by 1 (/1) instances [Tafoid].
- Argonaut SuperFX core improvement [anonymous]:
  * Hooked up Branch instructions;
  * Fixed numerous SuperFX core bugs;
  * Improved disassembler to more gracefully handle ALT* opcode effects;
  * Corrected instruction behaviors: STOP, SUB, SBC, SUBI, CMP;
  * Added LSR and ROL opcodes;
  * Updated instructions to use the safer superfx_gpr_write: LOOP, PLOT, INC, DEC;
  * Added missing register writeback to LMS;
  * Corrected carry flag behavior in ROL opcode;
  * Corrected BRA target address calculation (maybe still wrong);
  * Corrected LOOP target address calculation;
  * Made sure that FROM sets cpustate->sreg_idx;
  * Disabled RAM/ROM clocking, going with instant transfer for now.
  * Understood and re-enabled pipelined instruction architecture, Star Fox runs farther;
  * Fixed a ridiculous typo in ROL instruction;
  * Fixed overflow flag calculation on ADDI/ADCI;
  * Fixed lack of register reset after ADD/ADC/ADDI/ADCI.
- tmaster.c update [Luca Elia]:
  * Implemented carts banking and multiple EEPROMs;
  * Added "pen replacement" blit mode;
  * Fixed palette size.
- Discrete work [Couriersud]:
  * Change the way custom modules are handled;
  * Updated drivers mario and dkong accordingly;
  * Minor change to stream input handling;
  * No more linear lists for nodes. All node processing switched to linked lists;
  * Module step and reset now only get a node pointer passed;
  * Added discrete_info * pointer to node;
  * Only nodes with a step routine actually get processed;
  * Fixed a bug: discrete logs did not work since some time;
  * Preliminary parallel task constants; depending on results these may vanish again;
  * Overall slight performance increase. dkong 940% to 960%, galaxian 740% to 790%.
- Fix NULL timers crash in the mc6845 [hap].

- Added correct U2 sound ROM to the mk3 sets [MK3Fan - Mike].
- Discrete sound parallel tasks support [Couriersud]:
  * Introduced DISCRETE_TASK_START, DISCRETE_TASK_END;
  * DISCRETE_TASK_START: Start a new task. A task is a set of nodes which only depend on input nodes and nodes in the set;
  * DISCRETE_TASK_END(task_output_node): Marks the end of the task. task_output_node is the node whose output over time should be preserved. This node can be accessed by nodes in the main thread;
  * Illustrated the concept in the dkong discrete emulation. This also has been enhanced to buffer DAC output;
  * Discrete tasks now support multiple task output nodes.
- Further discrete changes [Couriersud]:
  * DISCRETE_OUTPUT now is a stepping node;
  * DISCRETE_STREAM_INPUT now advances input pointer in step;
  * More linked_list usage.

  * Made pbst30b a clone of pbst30 and added program versions to the name, IE: Pit Boss Supertouch 30 (9234-10-01).
- Fixed B-Rap Boys sound banking [Phil Bennett].
- Sigma Poker: Fixed duplicated definition of Hold 2 button. Added the missing Hold 3 button [Roberto Fresca].
- Continued discrete sound system "list-ification" [Couriersud]:
  * No more constraints on number of input and output nodes;
  * Input nodes now make use of a context.
- Removed osd_is_bad_read_ptr function [Aaron Giles].
