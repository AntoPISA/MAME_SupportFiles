Source changes:
---------------
- Added new function mame_debug_is_active() which can be used by core code to identify when we are paused in the debugger [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed crash when passing an invalid driver name on the command line. Centralized the approximate matching logic into driver.c so other ports can use it as well [Aaron Giles].
- Now properly extracting path from driver name and adding it to the rompath so that drag & drop of ZIP files works once again [Aaron Giles].
- More renderer updates [Aaron Giles]:
  * Fixed feature detection bug that led to false-positive warnings when starting up.
  * Removed extra vertex padding since some graphics cards could not cope with it.
  * Added shims to support both Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 8; D3D9 is the default, with an automatic fallback to d3d8 if not available.
  * New option -d3dversion can be used to specify preferred version for testing.
  * Added 1 pixel black border around all textures to ensure filtering on some cards doesn't result in garbage at the edge of the screen.
  * Enabled "do not wait" feature when unthrottled and using D3D9; this greatly speeds up unthrottled games, but seems to only work in full screen mode.
  * Switched from triangle fans to triangle strips.
  * Ensured that render states are only being set minimally.
  * Added code to reset the device if lost, allowing application  switching out of full screen mode and fixing multi-monitor mode with resolution switching.
- Added new function verbose_printf() which is used instead of checking the verbose global to print information to the screen. Changed all locations that were checking the global to use this new function [Aaron Giles].
