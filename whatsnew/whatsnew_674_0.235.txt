-Debugger-related feature removals and cleanup [AJR]
 * Remove the hotspot read tracker. This was never robustly implemented, but changes to the memory system made it much less useful,
    and the "speedup opportunities" which it aimed to determine are not very important from a current emulation standpoint.
 * Remove the CURSP/GENSP state symbol and the generic sp() getter. Stacking semantics vary too much between CPU architectures for
    this to be of much use. (A "SP" symbol has been added to a few CPU cores whose stack pointers were otherwise not being
    registered.)
 * Remove the cached pointer to device_state_interface and the state() fast accessor from device_t. Most users of
    device_state_interface either already had a pointer to the specific CPU device type or needed to check first for the presence of
    the interface.
 * Change the PC memory write tracker to use pcbase(), which works even when the instruction callback is masked out, instead of
    peeking at the PC history index.
 * Remove some obsolete watchpoint-related definitions from machine.h.

-divtlb.cpp: remove a crash caused by the modulus operator In the original code all values are signed integers, so m_dynindex would
 overflow and become negative, then the modulus of a negative value by a positive one would generate a negative result and finally
 the next array read would make the program crash. Also the maximum value plus one of m_dynindex is not generally a multiple of
 m_dynamic and this would cause a jump in the values of liveindex. [yz70s]
