Source changes:
---------------------
- FD1089 decryption [Nicola Salmoria, Charles MacDonald]:
  * 100% accurate emulation of FD1089A, FD1089B should be considered 99%  because it will have to be verified with other CPUs (it is 100% for all currently supported games).
  * Complete tables provided by Charles MacDonald for 317-0018 (Action Fighter), 317-0022 (Dunk Shot), 317-0168 (Aurail).
  * Partial tables derived by comparison with the unencrypted versions for 'Enduro Racer', 'Alex Kidd', 317-0024 (Time Scanner), 317-0033 (Alien Syndrome, 3 versions), 317-0027 (SDI). (actual working cpus are needed to obtain full	tables).
- Big Sega Update [Aaron Giles]:
  * dunkshot graphics correct, controls hooked up.
  * sdioj controls hooked up.
  * timescna sprites fixed.
  * shangona, shangnle now playable.

  * All memory mapping code unified and moved into machine/segaic16.c.
  * All tilemap, sprite, and road code unified and moved into vidhrdw/segaic16.c.
  * Improved documentation on the various register layouts on the video side.
  * Note that in the process, I broke the title screen animation for Laser Ghost, and there is now a 1-pixel column error on ddcrew's attract mode. These are known issues that I will try to address soon.
