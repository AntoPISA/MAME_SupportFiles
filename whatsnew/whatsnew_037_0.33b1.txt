These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Fixed glitches in 'Gemini Wing' and 'Rygar' [Li Jih Hwa].
- Fade-in/fade-out in 'Robocop' [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed colors in 'Centipede', including service mode multiplexed color test [Nicola Salmoria].


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------
- 'New Zealand Story' [Carlos A. Lozano].


Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- Fixed Atari System 1 games not accepting coins with -fm (actually -fm was supposed to be a no-op in this case since emulation of the YM2151 through OPL is not supported). You still have to keep sound on, however; disabling it will disable coins. Of course you can set the dip switches to Free Play and forget about coins [Nicola Salmoria].
- Service mode in 'Centipede' and 'Millipede' works [Brad Oliver].
- Added support for coin counters to some games [Brad Oliver].


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------
- Increased the watchdog period, to avoid unexpected resets in some MCR games [Nicola Salmoria].


Source changes:
----------------
- Drivers which dynamically change the palette are no longer required to initialize it in convert_color_prom(); they also can avoid initializing the color table, if the default layout for it (a 1:1 mapping) fits their needs. This is also useful when starting new drivers: you don't need to provide a fake palette or prom conversion function, the graphics will be visible somehow (but badly, so you had better change the defaults soon ;-) Also, games using PROMs don't need to initialize the colortable if the GfxDecodeInfo structure is properly initialized to make the correspondence 1:1 [Nicola Salmoria].
- For drivers using the GfxLayer system, dirty rectangle support is partially built-in into the core. The OS dependant rendering functions must use Machine->dirtylayer to know which portions of the screen need to be refreshed. Drivers which use the GfxLayer system no longer need the VIDEO_SUPPORTS_DIRTY flag in the MachineDriver structure - it must be turned on automatically by the OS dependant code [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added support for undocumented Z80 opcodes to the C Z80 core [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Improved speed of the C 68000 core (this is supposed to give a good speed increase, but I don't see any appreciable difference on my K6 - Nicola) [Juergen Buchmueller].
