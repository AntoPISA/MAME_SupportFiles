Source changes:
---------------
- [MCS48] Fixed I8021/I8022 clock divider [Curt Coder].
- 68HC05: CLR instruction should not affect the carry flag. Verified with Freescale programmer's manual [R. Belmont].
- Added 'buzzer' sound to Filetto and Tetris KR [Angelo Salese].
- Added delayed interrupts in idectrl to enable booting on some older BIOSes [Carl].
- Added preliminary superimposing flag for CGA, and implemented for 'Tetris KR', now it properly mixes between CGA graphics and external background [Angelo Salese].
- Added proper background hook-up for Tetris KR [Angelo Salese].
- Added Tourvision bios ver. 52 [f205v, Corrado Tomaselli].
- aquarium.c: removed region hack, fixed offtune music, fixed testmode [hap].
- ARM7: Fixed 39-in-1 booting [Tim Schuerewegen].
- arm7: Implemented MMU permission faults. Return correct MMU ID Code register values for ARM920T/ARM7500 [Tim Schuerewegen].
- Bulk conversion of bitmap_t * to bitmap_t & . With this change the parameters for the global SCREEN_UPDATE callback match the parameters for the driver_device version. Added allocate() and deallocate() methods to bitmap_t to permit cleaner handling of bitmaps in drivers and modern devices [Aaron Giles].
- Bulk converted cliprect * to cliprect & across the system. This makes cliprects mandatory everywhere. In general, cliprects were being correctly passed through the video side of most drivers already, so it is mostly a semantic change. Note that with my previous change, bitmaps have cliprects, so if you just want to clip to the bitmap's boundaries, pass bitmap->cliprect() instead of NULL (which is no longer permitted) [Aaron Giles].
- Change 'screen' parameter in SCREEN_UPDATE and SCREEN_EOF callbacks to a reference. Remove redundant machine parameter from SCREEN_EOF.
- chdman: don't be case sensitive on the input type extension [R. Belmont].
- chdman: Fixed -extractcd of images with postgaps.  CHDs do not need reconversion, this was an -extractcd problem only.l [R. Belmont].
- Converted bitmap_t and rectangle into proper classes. Replaced BITMAP_ADDR* macros with bitmap->pix* functions, and moved bitmap_fill() to bitmap->fill() among other similar changes. Bitmap fields now only available via accessors. Replaced sect_rect with &= and union_rect with |= operators for rectangle classes. Some general cleanup as a result of these changes [Aaron Giles].
- CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Dumped and added MB63B.1A PAL to slammast and clones [Kold666].
  * Fixed mbomberj, mbombrd, mbombrdj Q-Sound ROMs labels and locations, added Q-Sound PALs.
- CPS-3 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Dumped and added Street Fighter III 3rd Strike Euro BIOS, unlocked 2 new sets;
  * Minor fixes;
  * Reordered all sets per release date.
- Fix for inverted RON / REACH buttons in kiwames [Angelo Salese, Fujix].
- Fix four spc700 opcodes which didn't disassemble correctly [kevtris].
- Fixed Atari logo bad colors at POST in Area 51:Site 4 [Angelo Salese].
- Hooked up a proper VGA card for Psychic Force 2012 (waiting for further info about the VGA card used) [Angelo Salese].
- Hooked up basic devices in Queen and Midway Quicksilver HWs [Angelo Salese].
- Hooked up device in Savage Quest, dies at floppy error [Angelo Salese].
- Hooked up devices and flash loading for Funky Ball, game currently dies at a Voodoo color DAC register check [Angelo Salese].
- Hooked up devices for X-Tom 3d, gets to BOOT error if you soft reset once [Angelo Salese].
- i386: Moved stack changes to be after protection checks in RETF and IRET Made ARPL protected mode only Added protection checks when MOVing to a segment register [Barry Rodewald].
- i8251: Implemented transmit and receive data callbacks [Barry Rodewald].
- Implemented every single documented x87 co-processor opcodes in 386+ CPU cores [Angelo Salese].
- Implemented generic functions for RDMSR and WRMSR opcodes in Pentium CPU core (i.e. no MSR is actually hooked up so far) [Angelo Salese].
- Improved puzzli2 protection simulation [iq132].
- m680x0: Fix case where the MMU trashed memory [R. Belmont].
- mcr.c: added twotiger stereo 8-track tape sample playback [italie, Mr. Do, hap].
- OS/2 updates [KO Myung-Hun].
- PGM driver cleanups [David Haywood].
- Ported PC CGA device emulation from MESS to MAME, and updated Filetto and Tetris (KR) to use it accordingly [Angelo Salese].
- Rainbow Island driver cleanups + rename to avoid mess conflict [David Haywood].
- Remove old vestiges of driver_device video_eof override since it wasn't being used. Update all multi-screen games to use separate functions for each screen (calling into common code where appropriate) [Aaron Giles].
- Removed machine.generic.tmpbitmap, VIDEO_START(generic_bitmapped), and SCREEN_UPDATE(generic_bitmapped). In their place, each screen_device now maintains a default bitmap which is automatically copied to the screen on each update if no SCREEN_UPDATE function is provided and if no driver_device::video_update override is present. This bitmap can be found by querying the screen's new default_bitmap() method [Aaron Giles].
- Removed old C-based interface to astrings. astring exists only as a class now. Updated all stragglers (mostly tools) to use the class form [Aaron Giles].
- s3c24xx: Lots of changes for future Happy Fish 302-in-1 and Palm Z22 (MESS) drivers [Tim Schuerewegen].
- scsihd.c: Get sector size from CHD metadata to support old 256 bytes/sector SASI drives, and allow hard disk image subdevices [Curt Coder].
- segae.c: Updated driver to use the implementation from src/emu/video/315_5124.c and modernized driver [Enik Land, Wilbert Pol].
- Started converting steppers to simulate actual behavior in a more logical way, rather than using hardcoded tables [J. Wallace].
- uiimage/diimage: Dumbify the menus and add a control layer [Olivier Galibert].
- Worked around 0x3d8 VGA reading, and fixed California Chase in using the right VGA card [Angelo Salese].
