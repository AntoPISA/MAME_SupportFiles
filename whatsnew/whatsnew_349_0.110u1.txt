Source changes:
---------------
- Numerous improvements to the cheat engine again [ShimaPong]:
  - Operation:
  * Mounted copy prevous value.
  * Defined link extension bit in type field.
  * Improved one shot operation when restore previous value is available.
  - Menu:
  * Major update for classic search menu.
  * Arranged the cheat general menu a bit.
  * Improved item display for selection type code on the code edit screen.
  * Added entry index parameter to EditCheatMenu().
  - Watchpoint:
  * Added watchpoint for ROM region.
  * Improved adding watch from cheat list.
  - Activation key:
  * Added save activation key.
  * Added 2nd activation key.
  * Added show activation key message option.
  - Others:
  * Refined command code format.
- Added support for Fixed Interval Timer to the PPC403 core [Ville Linde].
- Polygonet Commanders update [Andrew Gardner]:
  * Added more accurate host interface to dsp56k core.
  * Removed a bunch of hacks in plygonet.c.
- Added flip screen offsets needed with new video parameters in the pacman.c driver [Aaron Giles].
- Added new field Machine->basename which is used to describe the path used for various file accesses. This is a helper for MESS, and should not have any user-visible changes. The file accesses affected are: configuration (cfg) files, snapshots, debugger comments, NVRAM, and memory cards [Aaron Giles].
- Changed artwork layout loading to load either gamename/gamename.lay or gamename/default.lay. The latter is preferred, and allows for easier reuse of layouts between games [Aaron Giles].
- Changed naming of screenshots. They are now created in separate folders per game, with numeric names 0000.png, 0001.png, etc. [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed max instruction bytes for 68020+ CPUs to avoid assertion in new disassembler [Aaron Giles].
