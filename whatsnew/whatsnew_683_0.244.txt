    where the floppy device was (mistakenly?) set to FLOPPY_525_QD (quad density) from FLOPPY_525_SSDD (single-sided
    double-density).
 * As far as I am aware, the Osborne1 only supported SSSD and SSDD disks. Revert appears to resolve known Osborne1 issues

   - Also added a couple of demos that I found laying around in a very old backup, and which aren't already included in any cover
      tapes:
     * LSD Megademo
     * The Ren and Stimpy Slideshow (a kind of lame slideshow of a few black and white pics, but with a decent presentation)

-ksys573.cpp: Notes/typos + note changes for DDR Karaoke (#9710) [simzy39]
 * The bottom of the driver says '"Dance Dance Revolution Karaoke Mix (GQ921 VER. JBB)"' which is hard to deduce as being 'DAM-DDR
    Dance Dance Revolution for DAM' at the top of the driver. As such, I've changed it to: "Dance Dance Revolution Karaoke MIX
    (DAM-DDR)" and "Dance Dance Revolution Karaoke MIX 2nd (DAM-DDR)" based on what I've found on the internet. This name appears to
    be accurate, at least for the system. The game disc itself doesn't contain the name DAM. A few sources:
    https://remywiki.com/AC_DDR_Karaoke https://bcaweb.bai.ne.jp/miyooo/ddrd.html
 * : In the list, there is a 'P' next to these names, denoting 'plain System573', but according to my first source: DDR KAraoke
    "...uses a modified System 573, equipped with four video input/output and a DAM karaoke device." As such I've changed the P to
    'K' and have changed Kick and Kick's letter, which was a K, to AA since it's a similar board to the A. A: uses ext. analog I/O
    board GX700-PWB(F) AA: uses alt. ext. analog I/O board GX700-PWB(K) K: uses karaoke I/O board GX921-PWB(B)
 * 'DDR max' and 'DDR max 2' to 'DDRMAX' and 'DDRMAX2'

-cpu/mips/r4000.cpp: Added TimerIntDis mux to IPEX5 (#9718) [Brice Onken]

-bus/nes: Various minor cleanups (#9641) [kmg]
 * MMC1: Made mirroring bits overridable for derivative boards. Also removed code for rumored MMC1C variant.
 * Moved various boards' hardwired mirroring from pcb_reset() to the software list.
 * Removed redundant banking of VRAM for non-banking boards and redundant variable setting.

-a2600.xml: Fixed publishers, and mark generalr/westward as clones of custer (#9623) [eientei95]
 * "Mystique" was a product line, actual publisher was "American Multiple Industries".

-8080bw.cpp: Re-removed cocktail inputs from spaceat2/sinvzen (#9624) [eientei95]

-slapfght.cpp: Hooked up flip screen output to MCU for alcon and slapfigh (#9748) [Vas Crabb]
 * slapfght.cpp: Hooked up flip screen output to MCU for alcon and slapfigh.
 * machine/taito68705interface.cpp: Removed some copy/pasted copyright holders.
   - The copyright holders were copied across from the drivers that the device was factored out of.  There's no content from the
      original drivers left.

 * Partially addresses GitHub #9757.  Coin 2 doesn't work for targ and spectar, but that isn't a regression (it was already broken,
    not sure if error in schematics, game bug, or emulation issue is to blame).  DIP switches and locations are still a bit of a
    mess, too.

-netlist: Improved PPMF target support and test coverage (#9752) [Couriersud]
 * This addresses most of the issues described in #8590.
   - Fixed standalone Visual Studio 2019 builds, including support for clang toolchain.
   - Added static stub to PMF to support MSVC ABI.
   - Better aligned ppmf syntax with MAME's delegate syntax.
   - Add tests/test_ppmf*.cpp testing examples given in #8590.

New clones marked as NOT_WORKING
--------------------------------
The House of the Dead (Revision A) [egregiousguy]

-seta.cpp: added hardware info for Caliber 50 [Guru]

-snk.cpp: added hardware info for Ikari Warriors [Guru]

-netlist: Fixes to address PR #9752 and issue #8590 / EMSCRIPTEN (#9773) [Couriersud]
 * netlist: pointer to member function code
   - Address PR #9752 and issue #8590
   - change comments in ppmf.h
   - add support for function desciptors (IA64)
   - sizeof(size_t) may be different on build targets make plib::hash use uint64 to ensure consistent static solver hashes across
      platforms (EMSCRIPTEN)
   - Moved constructor and member functions outside the class declaration with the exception of "call" member functions.
   - Updated comment on accessing RDX
   - Added more test cases
     * Removed execution bit on certain files I have separated out the raw processing code into `ppmf.cpp`. I have also taken first
        steps to clean the abi identification.
       - The code submitted now supports:
       - a) The unknown virtual inheritance case with specific code for MSVC for simple (i.e. scalar, void, reference, pointer)
          return types using the optimized code. This is the test case only supported under MSVC and which should return 7. Please
          have a look at the code. Basically m_vptr_offset is an index into a pointer table. It needs to be multiplied by
          `sizeof(void *)`.
       - b) If you enable PPMF_EXPERIMENTAL complex return type member functions for MSVC will also use the optimized code path.
          This is explained in detail in the code in ppmf, including caveats and possible solutions.
       - c) Enabling PPMF_USE_MAME_DELEGATES will use `src/lib/util/delegate.h` as a replacement for `ppmf.h`. This allows to run
          the same tests (`nltool -c tests` from standalone build) as for the ppmf code.
       - d) The code now also supports `clang-cl`
       - e) sizeof(size_t) may be different on build targets.
       - Make plib::hash use uint64 to ensure consistent static solver hashes across platforms. This fixes loading static solvers
          (if enabled) on EMSCRIPTEN.

-Updated Commodore LCD colors, based on recent pictures from one of the prototypes [smf].
 * Fixed Commodore LCD real time clock reading, it relies on the RTC chip being able to ground PORT A while it is set to an output.
    Which is documented in the 6522 datasheet as being possible. It's NMOS, so it has weak pull ups and doesn't drive it's output
    hard. However due to a bug in the prototype ROM code, it currently has the date and month swapped round [smf].
