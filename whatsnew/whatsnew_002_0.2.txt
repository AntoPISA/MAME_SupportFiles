Usage:
------

MAME [name of the game to run] [options]

for example

MAME mspacman -nosound   will run Ms Pac Man without sound

options:
-noscanlines  use alternate video mode (not availble in all games). Use this
              if the default mode doesn't work with your monitor/video card.
-vesa         use standard 640x480x256 VESA mode instead of custom video mode.
              Use this as a last resort if -noscanlines doesn't solve your
			  video problems.
-nosound      turn off sound
-nojoy        don't poll joystick
-log          create a log of illegal memory accesses in ERROR.LOG
-frameskip n  skip frames to speed up the emulation. For example, if the game
              normally runs at 60 fps, "-skipframe 1" will make it run at 30
			  fps, and "-skipframe 2" at 20 fps. Use F11 to check the fps your
			  computer is actually displaying. If the game is too slow,
			  increase the frameskip value. Note that this setting can also
			  affect audio quality (some games sound better, others sound
			  worse).

The following keys work in all emulators:

3       Insert coin
1       Start 1 player game
2       Start 2 players game
Tab     Change dip switch settings
P       Pause
F3      Reset
F11     Activate fps counter
F12     Save a screen snapshot
ESC     Exit emulator


Pac Man ("pacman")
------------------
Arrows  Move around
F1      Skip level
F2      Test mode
CTRL    Speed up cheat

Clones supported:
  Pac Man modification ("pacmod")
  Namco Pac Man ("namcopac")
  Hangly Man ("hangly")
  Puck Man ("puckman")
  Piranha ("piranha")

Known issues:
- Blinky and Pinky seem to be shifted one pixel to the right. This is really annoying, but I can't seem to be able to understand why. Maybe there is an additional "sprite offset" register somewhere? Or did the original just behave this way?
  Note that we can't fix it by just moving sprites 0 and 1 one pixel to the left, because when Pac Man eats a power pill the sprites order is changed so that Pac Man is drawn over the ghosts. It becomes sprite 0, and Blinky becomes sprite 4.

Ms Pac Man ("mspacman")
-----------------------
Arrows  Move around
F1      Skip level
F2      Test mode
CTRL    Speed up cheat

Crush Roller ("crush")
----------------------
Crush Roller is a hacked version of Make Trax, modified to run on a Pac Man board.

Arrows  Move around
F1      Skip level

Known issues:
- There's the same problem with sprites as in Pac Man, but here it could be fixed without apparent side effects.

Pengo ("pengo")
---------------
Arrows  Move around
CTRL    Push
F1      Skip level
F2      Test mode

Clones supported:
