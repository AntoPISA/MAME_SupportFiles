---------------------------------------
[NOTE: only important changes are listed]


New games supported
-------------------
(bagmans)  Bagman [Nicola Salmoria]
(wow)      Wizard of Wor [Nicola Salmoria, Mike Coates]


Program changes:
----------------
- Bagman support (wrong colors) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Early Wizard of Wor support (not playable) [Nicola Salmoria, Mike Coates].
- New experimental AY-3-8910 sound emulation code provided by Andy Milne (andy@canetics.com). This sounds better in some places and worse in others. It is used by Crazy Climber, Crazy Kong and Bagman. Let me know what you think [Nicola Salmoria].


Source changes:
---------------
- Optimizations in drawgfx(), Mr. Do!'s title screen and intermissions now run faster, Crazy Climber and Crazy Kong benefit as well [Nicola Salmoria].
- Use version 1.1 of Z80Em by Marcel de Kogel. Faster! (note that I had to make a couple of changes to Z80.c to make Crazy Climber work) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Handle IN and OUT instructions in the same way as memory accesses (table of handler functions). The parameters of the functions are the same, so the same  action can be used both for memory and ports. Had to change the driver structure, removed the pointers to _in and _out functions and added port_read and port_write array pointers. Also defined a generic interrupt_vector_w() function, this makes the Pac Man driver tinier (look at pacman/machine.c, it's now there only to handle the cheat) [Nicola Salmoria].
