Source changes:
---------------
- A number of obsolete backward compatibility macros have been removed. See this list for the equivalents if you have a driver that is using them [Aaron Giles]:
  
  cpu_set_reset_line -> cpunum_set_input_line
  cpu_set_halt_line -> cpunum_set_input_line
  cpu_set_irq_line -> cpunum_set_input_line
  cpu_set_irq_line_and_vector -> cpunum_set_input_line_and_vector
  timer_suspendcpu -> cpunum_suspend/cpunum_resume
  timer_holdcpu -> cpunum_suspend/cpunum_resume
  cpu_getstatus -> cpunum_is_suspended
  timer_get_overclock -> cpunum_get_clockscale
  timer_set_overclock -> cpunum_set_clockscale
  cpu_gettotalcycles -> cpunum_gettotalcycles
  cpu_gettotalcycles64 -> cpunum_gettotalcycles64
  keyboard_name -> code_name
  keyboard_pressed -> code_pressed
  keyboard_pressed_memory -> code_pressed_memory
  keyboard_pressed_memory_repeat -> code_pressed_memory_repeat
  keyboard_read_async -> code_read_async
  install_mem_read*_handler -> memory_install_read*_handler
  install_mem_write*_handler -> memory_install_write*_handler
  install_port_read*_handler -> memory_install_read*_handler
  install_port_write*_handler -> memory_install_write*_handler
  memory_install_read*_handler_mirror -> memory_install_read*_handler
  memory_install_write*_handler_mirror -> memory_install_write*_handler

  READ_HANDLER -> READ8_HANDLER

- Added ADSP2181 variant to the ADSP21xx CPU cores [Aaron Giles].
- Added consistency checking for the year field [Nathan Woods].
- Added support for many more instruction forms in x86drc.h [Aaron Giles].
- Miscellaneous cleanups and refactorings done primarily to support a new MESS specific feature. Also removed some '#if 0' code [Nathan Woods].
- New input port definitions, similar to the new memory map definitions. You can continue to use the old PORT_BIT, PORT_BITX, and PORT_ANALOG macros for now, but it is preferred going forward that all ports use only PORT_BIT, and append all other flags and options using the new macros. See pacman.c for an example of the new format. The new input ports also support tagging for easier tracking of ports, and the ability to import port definitions from another set [Nathan Woods].
- New option in the Windows version: -wavwrite to save sound output to a WAV file [smf].
- Removed -listinfo option now that xml2info produces fully correct output [Aaron Giles].
- Removed some silly 6502 speedups in the Atari games [Aaron Giles].
- Two minor fixes to xml2info so that 'MAME -listxml|xml2info' matches 'mame -listinfo' exactly [Logiqx].
