Source changes:

- Added proper sound to yieartf set [Angelo Salese].
- Added Sound NMI mask to Alpha68k II / V HW games [Angelo Salese].
- Confirmed Gal Panic 3's clocks and xtals from original PCB measurements [Corrado Tomaselli].

- Converted chsuper.c to ADDRESS_MAP_MODERN [Angelo Salese].
- Converted Super Speed Race Jr video to be vertically oriented [Angelo Salese].
- CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Dumped and added CD63B.1A PAL to dino, dinou [Kold666].

  * Dumped and added Q-Sound PALs to dino, dinou, punisher, punisheru, slammast, slammastu, wofu (3 of 4) [Kold666].
  * Fixed pang3, pang3j to use proper 128KB EPROM PA3_11.11F instead of the one resized used by pang3n.
  * Identified and documented pang3n as a bootleg, added a note.
  * Minor cleanups and fixes.
  * Renamed (pang3n) to (pang3b).

- segas32.c: Corrected ROM labels and added PCB locations to 'F1 Super Lap' [The Dumping Union].
