MAME Testers Bugs Fixed (4):
---------------------------
- 03964: [Documentation] shangonro: Year is wrong (Smitdogg)
- 03969: [Crash/Freeze] All sets and drivers using OKI audio: Eventual crash using Save States (Aaron Giles)
- 03977: [Graphics] tceptor2: Graphics are incorrect, the top and bottom roads are displayed with grids and it looks like there should be 4 instead of 2 (Phil Bennett)
- 03981: [Crash/Freeze] bosco, xevious and clones: Game reboots or hangs (Alex Jackson)


Source changes:
---------------
- raiden2.c: Add missing "VOICE2" sample ROM to Raiden 2 sets where it was missing. Corrected ROM names for MASK roms soldered to the PCB [Brian Troha].
- Southern Systems Joker Poker: Added missing CPU IO map to the machine driver. This allow boot the game and enter into the attract mode [Roberto Fresca].
- Mini Boy 7 improvements [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added a new complete set. Now set as parent;
  * Corrected Xtal frequency;
  * Mapped the PIA MC6821 (not wired since is not totally understood);
  * Preliminary attempt to decode the color PROM;
  * Mapped the AY-3-8910, but still needs ports and some checks;
  * Added debug and technical notes.
- New driver for Mega Double Poker, from Blitz System Inc [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Initial release;
  * Preliminary memory map;
  * Hooked both PIAs, but need more analysis to confirm the offsets;
  * Accurate graphics and color decode;
  * Added main PCB and daughterboard layouts;
  * Added partial docs and diagrams about the CPU/MCU/ROMs addressing;
  * Added debug and technical notes.
- Added Magic Train, from Subsino. Since it's driven by a HD647180X0CP6 (Subsino - SS9600) plus SS9601 and SS9602 (for video and I/O respectively), it's possible that needs to be moved to a new driver in a near future. Also added technical notes [Roberto Fresca].
- mpu4drvr.c: Fixed mid-screen palette updates [David Haywood].
- segas16b.c: Documented the Sega game ID for the Heavyweight Champ ROM board as well as corrected the ROM names [Brian Troha].
- Return to type safety. Changed address maps back into functions that build up the definition, rather than the whole tokenizing system which lost type checking. Added a new module addrmap.c which implements the address map classes, and changed the macros to call methods on the address_map and address_map_entry classes which are strongly typed. Fixed a few incorrectly specified memory map entries along the way in twincobr.c, lordgun.c, galaxold.c [Aaron Giles].
- More API cleanup [Aaron Giles]:
  * Removed cputag_clocks_to_attotime() and cputag_attotime_to_clocks() in favor of just expanding the class;
  * Same for cputag_suspend() and cputag_resume().
- Fix crash when exiting the debugger if breakpoints are set [Aaron Giles].
- The dsp561xx CPU core now generates accurate disassembly for Konami Polygonet hardware (verified against Motorola's reference disassembler) [Andrew Gardner, Stiletto].
- Fixed image device error handling [ShimaPong, Miodrag Milanovic].
- Defined new class driver_data_t, which all driver_data classes must derive from. Updated all class definitions to inherit from the new class, and to call it in the constructor. Also changed the alloc() signature to return a driver_data_t pointer instead of a void * [Aaron Giles].
- Renamed and hid machine->driver_data as machine->m_driver_data. Added a new templatized method machine->driver_data<class> which returns a properly downcast'ed version of the driver data. Updated all code which looked like this [Aaron Giles]:

  mydriver_state *state = (mydriver_state *)machine->driver_data;

  to this:

  mydriver_state *state = machine->driver_data<mydriver_state>();

- The new function does a downcast<> which in debug builds dynamically verifies that you're actually casting to the right type [Aaron Giles].
- Changed atarigen_state to be a base class from which all the related Atari drivers derive their state from [Aaron Giles].
- Removed global variables from gaelco, namco, and nile sound cores [Atari Ace].
- Converted seta.c, seta2.c, and ssv.c to driver_data [Atari Ace].
- Updated SAA5050 to form 12x20 chars as noted in documentation. Updated malzak driver to support SAA5050 changes [Miodrag Milanovic].
- taitotz: add HDD image for Battle Gear 2 (2.04J) [gtbb08, R. Belmont].
- namcoic.c: Fixed incorrect road colours in tceptor2, finallap and others [Phil Bennett].
- Fixed road transparency in 'Thunder Ceptor' [Phil Bennett].
- Fixed Z80 SIO interrupts by clearing them at constructor time so Z80 daisy chain works properly and doesn't stall on a non-existant IEO condition [Curt Coder].
- Z80 DMA changes [Curt Coder]:
  * Fixed DMA by re-adding a status update call to ENABLE DMA command;
  * Allowed illegal mode 0 DMA operation since trs80m2 in MESS is abusing this;
  * Fixed ready signal handling by adding a check for ready condition on each byte.
- Started converting the Toaplan2 VDP into a device [David Haywood].
- dsp56k: Hooked up new execution engine [Andrew Gardner].
- plygonet.c: Updates Polygonet driver to use driver_data class [Atari Ace].
- More refactoring to the Toaplan 2 / GP9001 VDP device [David Haywood].
- CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Expanded and updated games table in video\cps1.c;
  * Confirmed B-Board # for 3wondersu, varth;
  * Fixed labels in ghouls, ghoulsu to match real PCBs;
  * Removed 14.bin in dynwarj, it was a bad dump;
  * Marked nm_23.12b in nemoj BAD_DUMP;
  * Removed knightsja set (roms were split & hacked to work on a suicided board);
  * Added roms relationship between parent/clones where missing;
  * Fixed some incorrect notes added in previous update;
  * Renames (dynwaru) to (dynwara), (forgottnua) to (forgottnu), (forgottnu) to (forgottnua) and (wofhfb) to (wofhfh), as real name Huo Feng Huang;
  * Reordered some sets;
  * Minor cleanups;
  * Fixed sf2ceua labels and added PCB infos;
  * Fixed sf2ceub labels and added pcb infos, removed 1 incorrect ROM and replaced with proper redump done by Dumping Union;
  * Fixed punisher, punisheru Q-Sound labels and added D-Board PALs.
- dsp56k.c: Remove globals from dsp56k cpu core [AtariAce].
- cps1.c: Documentation update for some CPS1 sets (B-Board chip information) verified via Team Japump PCB photos [Brian Troha].
- Improved memory banking in 'Puzzle Star' (Sang Ho Soft) [Mariusz Wojcieszek].
- Fixed term2 (rev. LA4) freeze during the Cyberdyne stage opening cinematic [Phil Bennett].
- Merged aladbl.c and ssf2md.c to create genesisb.c [Sonikos].
- video/astrocde.c: Limited the number of timers potentially produced astrocade_trigger_lightpen() [ranger_lennier].
- cps1.c: Set correct B-Board mapper for "resale" kits. This fixes missing graphics in 'Area 88' (Japan Resale) [Brian Troha].
