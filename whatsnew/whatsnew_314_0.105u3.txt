Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed and cleaned up the DIP switches in the dec0 driver [Roberto Fresca].
- More improvements to the PGM video code. Also added hooks for halting the sound CPU which allows ddp2 to boot [David Haywood].
- Fixed incorrect lightgun names [Derrick Renaud].
- Fixed 'Bonze Adventure' levels 2 and 9 [Bryan McPhail].
- Refactored the 8530 CIA code from the Amiga into a separate module and made it support both the 6526 and 8530 variants [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed/improved DIP switches in the megasys1, dietgo, and yunsun16 drivers [Twisty].
- Fixed some DIP switches and added controls for 2nd player in cocktail mode in 'Lost Castle in Darkmist' [Sonikos].
- Fixed a number of issues in the Windows rendering code [Giuseppe Gorgoglione]:
  * Fixed blit_vectors so it used the dirty pixel array in D3D mode.
  * Fixed blit_vectors rotation issue for dirty pixels as well.
  * Changed -full_screen_brightness to -full_screen_gamma (which is a more correct description).
  * Changed -d3dfilter to be a boolean, since the other filtering modes are either obsolete or not applicable to MAME.
  * Removed limitations on windowing position so you no longer need to be aligned on an 8-pixel boundary.
  * Cleaned up a number of unused global variables.
  * Improved multi-monitor support to work in GDI mode as well as in non-full-screen modes.
  * Added missing documentation for the -screen parameter.
- Fixed some remaining errors and inconsistencies in the content and usage of MAME header files by comparing declarations against actual definitions. Removed many orphaned/duplicate declarations. Added #includes where appropriate, and moved a few declarations to another file when they were in the wrong location [Atari Ace].
- Removed a number of unused ROM regions. Most (but not all) of the empty ROM region warnings are now taken care of. Also uncommented/added missing undumped ROMs/XORs in the Namco and CPS2 games [Aaron Giles].
- More Amiga cleanups [Aaron Giles]:
  * Fixed dual playfield mode.
  * Rewrote blitter code (fixes glitches in ar_bowl and others).
  * Changed Arcadia boot loading to use ROMtags instead of autoconfig.
  * Swapped Kickstart 1.2 in for Arcadia BIOS (fixes ar_sdwr).
