Source changes:
---------------
- MC6845 changes [Curt Coder]:
  * Added cursor and display enable skewing.
  * Added preliminary support for SY6545-1's transparent addressing mode.
  * Hsync should be pulsed even when vsync is active.
- Removed per-game hacks from CPS3 (moved to DMA callback in SH2 core). Removed Speedups from CPS3 / PsikyoSH, while they do still give a decent speed boost they're not really needed with the DRC and just clutter the code [David Haywood].
- Minor NeoGeo cleanups [JohnBoy].
- Rewrite of the Motorola DSP56k CPU core [Andrew Gardner]:
  * Complete rewrite focusing on legibility and extensibility.
  * 27/121 opcodes (mostly) implemented.
  * Bugfix for reset status of interrupt priority bits.
  * Bugfix for disassembly of register-to-register parallel data move.
  * Added additional branch, move and bitfield ops.
  * Plygonet now passes its memory test and uploads a new program.
  * Implemented tst, or, jsr, rti, tst2, and 2 new movec ops.
  * Added opbase handler to plygonet.c.
- Increase cubeqst interleave factor to eliminate LDP timeout countdown flicker [Philip Bennett].
- Added redumped 'B-Rap Boys' sample ROMs [Guru].
- Cleaned up STV ROM loading a bit [David Haywood].
- NamcoNBx: Fixed C75 BIOS loading for big-endian targets [R. Belmont].
- Updated tnzs.c driver [stephh]:
  * Renamed sets: (tnzsjn) to (tnzsj), (tnzsj) to (tnzsjo) and (kagekia) to (kagekih).
  * Fixed DIP Switches for all games (2 remaining unknown DIPs in plumppop and jpopnics though).
  * Added many notes.
- Small cleanups to the ST-V driver. Make some work for magzun, still not working [Angelo Salese].
- AICA: Fix sample addressing for the full 8 MB [kingshriek].
- Fixed bnstars1 screens [David Haywood].
- MCS51/I8051 overhaul, micro3d improvements and full m72 protection emulation for lohtb2 [Couriersud, Jim Stolis]:
  * Improved serial port timing.
  * Better infrastructure for adding more variants like DS5002.
  * Fixed port reading.
  * Rewrote Macros for better readibility.
  * Fixed and rewrote Interrupt handling.
  * Now returns INTERNAL_DIVIDER, adjusted cycle counts.
  * Remove unnecessary and duplicated code.
  * Remove unnecessary functions.
  * Rewrite to have sfr-registers stored in int_ram. 
  * Debugger may now watch sfr-registers as well.
  * Implemented interrupt callbacks (HOLD_LINE now supported).
  * Runtime switch for processor type - remove ifdefs.
  * Internal memory maps for internal ROM versions (internal RAM now displayed in debugger).
  * More timer cleanups from manual.
  * Fix timer 2 interrupts.
  * Implement serial mode 2/3 rx and tx clock handling.
  * Remaining games checked and adapted to changes in cpu core.
  * Cardline still broken. I need the exact and complete cpu name.
  * Added more variants 803X, 80CXX, AT89C4051.
  * Fix segas18.c (segaic16.c) mcu maps. 
  * Fix sslam.c.
  * Fix limenko.c videopkr.c : Issue with core allocation of RAM (duplicate savestate).
- micro3d improvements [Couriersud]:
  * Serial port communication between main CPU and Sound Board works.
  * Sound board now works.
- m72, lohtb2 improvements [Couriersud]:
  * Full emulation of protection device.
  * Samples are now piped through the MCU.
- Added sound and corrected wrong DIP-SW in the Double Dealer driver. Completed protection vectors, fixed video emulation and added coin setting simulation [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed recently regressed raster interrupt issues in fuukifg* drivers [Philip Bennett].
- Added flip screen / cocktail support to yumefude driver. Completed DIP-Switches (manual-wise) and made better comments [Angelo Salese].
- Separated umk3 and breakrev from their parents [David Haywood].
- Some reorganization in megadriv.c, porting over some code to attempt to get it working again, bit by bit [David Haywood].
- Improved dakkochn gfx; the priority are ok but there are various offset so i marked also the game as "inperfect gfx" [Sonikos].
- Fixed a subtle bug in the 65c02 emulation where the result of the BIT instruction differs on the 65c02 (from the 6502), when executed in immediate mode [Phill Harvey-Smith].
- Added samples suppor to Cosmic Alien [T. Bellm].
