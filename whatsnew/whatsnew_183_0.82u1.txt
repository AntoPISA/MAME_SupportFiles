Source changes:
----------------------
- Made R3000 version of Area 51 parent set [smf].
- memory.c patch. Introduces memory_install_[read|write][8|16|32|64]_handler_mirror() calls, which install memory handlers that can mirror similar to the AM_MIRROR macro [Nathan Woods].
- STV VDP-1 update [Mariusz Wojcieszek]:
  * Converted VDP1 drawing (sprites) to use framebuffer.
  * Added sprite priorities (corrects shanhigw ingame and colmns97 title screen).
  * Added color offset for sprites.
  * Improved sprites alpha blending (improves ejihon and shienryu intro).
  * Added framebuffer interlace (fixes elandore character selection screen).
  * Added color offset for bitmaps.
  * Added vertical scrolling for bitmaps (corrects shanhigw ingame).
- The main result (visible to user) of these changes is that shanhigw is now playable without problems (apart from gfx glitches on title screen).
