Apache 3 [Bryan McPhail]

Round Up 5 [Bryan McPhail]


Source changes:
---------------
- Minor Compiler fixes [Brad Oliver].
- Removed options.color_depth (obsolete anyway) [Brad Oliver].
- Compiler Fixes for VC [Bryan McPhail]:
  * src\drivers\suprgolf.c: C99 fix;
  * src\cpu\m37710\m37710op.h: Fixed warnings under VC;
  * src\cpu\powerpc\ppc.c : Fixed warnings under VC;
  * src\cpu\powerpc\ppc403.c: Fixed warnings under VC.
- Added default eeprom to Recalhorn to prevent crash [Bryan McPhail].
- Fixed Mametesters bug sotsugyo069u3gre. sotsugyo: On the result screen (the one that appears when finishing a stage i.e after the first two trials), zeroes don't appear at all [Bryan McPhail].
- Modified tilemap.c so roz and RGB_DIRECT can be used together [Andrew Gardner].
- Fixed I/O addresses in Hyperstone and so removed the hack from vamphalf driver [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Yumefuda update (EEPROM etc.) [Gondos, Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed some gfx in tmmjprd [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- i960 updates [R. Belmont]:
  * Added support for the following opcodes: nor, addc, subc, atanr, sinr, cosr, tanr, atanrl, logrl, sinrl, cosrl, and tanrl;
  * Added those and some others to the disassembler;
  * Added parens for the compiler warning;
  * Fixed stt to only store 3 words instead of 4;
  * Added logepr and cvtri;
  * Fixed cmpr and cmprl - they were comparing garbage instead of the correct registers;
  * Added disassembly for movrl;
  * Added scanbit;
  * Rewrote flushreg, it was *totally* wrong before. HOTD now runs, among others;
  * Added hack to divo so divide by zero doesn't crash MAME (some games read back 0 from the not-yet-existing DSP and do this);
  * More disassembler improvements;
  * Added NAND, EDIV, SCALER, SCALERL, ROUNDR, ROUNDRL, EXPRL, MOVRE, and CPYSRE opcodes;
  * Fixed some errors in interrupt handling. Solves corrupt graphics in fvipers and crashes in fvipers, schamp, and dynamcop;
  * Added REMR opcode.
- SegaIC24 update. Add 32-bit access methods for char and tile RAM [R. Belmont].
- Grand Champion sound fix [Justin Szczap].
- INP changes: Basically, reading/writing analog port data every single time interpolate_analog_port() isn't a good idea, especially since it's called every time readinputport() is. I've just moved the analogue port reading/writing into the for loop, so analogue ports are only read/written if the port is actually is analogue [Barry Rodewald].
- Dynagears dip fix [Derrick Renaud].
- ZN1/ZN2 big endian fix [smf].
- SPI decryption improvements (for rf2_2k) [Ville Linde].
- Tatsumi driver [Bryan McPhail] (playable to a degree, but not really working properly): Incredibly complex hardware! These are all different boards, but share a similar sprite chip (TZB215 on Apache 3, TZB315 on others). Other graphics (road, sky, bg/fg layers) all differ between games. Todo:
  * Sprite rotation;
  * Finish road layer (Round Up 5);
  * Implement road layer (Apache 3, Cycle Warriors);
  * BG layer(s) (Cycle Warriors);
  * BG layer (Round Up 5) - May be driven by missing VRAM data;
  * Round Up 5 always boots with a coin inserted;
  * Round Up 5 doesn't survive a reset;
  * DIP switches;
  * Various other things.
- Sega Model 2 driver (see model2.c for list of games): Tilemaps, sound, and inputs working to varying degrees in various games.  Most of the games at least start up, although some don't and some crash [R. Belmont].
