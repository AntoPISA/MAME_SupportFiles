Source changes:
---------------
- Improved the cidelsa driver [Curt Coder]:
  * Rewrote the cdp1802 CPU emulation as a state machine;
  * Fixed Draco dips and inputs (what a strange game!);
  * Added NVRAM to Destroyer/Draco (Altair has no battery on the PCB);
  * Fixed some clocks.
- Fixed mapping of spaceship controls in spcenctr [Canim].
- Removed the inclusion of unnecessary header files across the project [Atari Ace].
- Added discrete filters to the new Namco 54xx sound effects. Also implemented filters for the 52xx sound effects in preparation for future changes [Derrick Renaud].
- Added pause support to the output system [Bob Seidel]:
  * Added "pause" message through the Output system to let clients know when MAME is paused;
  * The state of an item is now sent when the item is first created;
  * Updated ledutil to use the pause state.
- Added cocktail mode and DIP locations to the Millipede driver [Mike Haaland].
- Many more CPS2 keys added. Removed all XORs and support for them from MAME [Nicola Salmoria, Andreas Naive].
- Fixed regression in the ar_xeon driver sprites [Ernesto Corvi].
- Kaneko driver improvements:
  * bloodwar: Protection data extracted, still needs to be verified.
  * Collision detection simulation thanks to tests on real board [Gary Walkling, Sebastien Volpe].
  * bonkadv: Protection data fully verified: corrects tilemap colors in levels 2 and 3.
  * Correct implementation of MCU command 43 [Guru, Sebastien Volpe].
- Fixed behavior of MOVEC instruction on later 680x0 chips, and in the disassembler [Ernesto Corvi].
- Properly idenitified sound ROMs for 'Altered Beast set 2' [Brian Troha].
- Fixed bad bits in a couple of FD1094 keys [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug in debugger that caused incorrect end offsets to be computed on CPUs with an address shift [Ville Linde].
- Moved some additional pieces of core functionality in the the core utility library [Nathan Woods].
- Added sound to porky [Tomasz Slanina].
- Changed font scaling again. Fonts 24 pixels tall and above are scaled the old way. Fonts smaller than that are scaled via integral scale factors and adjusted the new way [Aaron Giles].
- Added a small optimization to the FD1094 decoding step [Aaron Giles].
- Added several new modules to the utility library libutil. First is a generic huffman encoding module. Second is a module that allows you to read/write AVI files in a platform-independent way. And third is a lossless A/V compression module. These three pieces together, plus some changes in the CHD code, allow for the creation of CHDs with compressed audio and video [Aaron Giles].
- Added two new commands to chdman: -createav converts an AVI file in uncompressed YUY format or HuffYUV-compressed YUY format with "left" prediction into a CHD. And -extractav converts a CHD containing compressed audio & video into an uncompressed YUY format AVI file [Aaron Giles].
- Finished hooking up laserdisc support to the new audio/video compression. Note that we still do not have canonical CHDs of laserdisc data at the moment, but all the support is now present for when they start to appear [Aaron Giles].
