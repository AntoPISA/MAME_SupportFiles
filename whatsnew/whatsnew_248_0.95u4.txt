- Removed CPU_16BIT_PORT hack; this means that all Z80 drivers must explicitly. clamp their I/O space address space to 8-bits via ADDRESS_MAP_FLAGS(AMEF_ABITS(8)) [Aaron Giles].
- Removed CPU_AUDIO_CPU; it was no longer having any effect, and it was a poor substitution for documentation since it wasn't used consistently across all games [Aaron Giles].
