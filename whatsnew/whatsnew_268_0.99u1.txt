Source changes:
---------------
- Undid a hack that was accidentally left in the MCR games in the last release [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug in spiders that caused bad video in cocktail mode [Hans Andersson].
- Fixed several problems in the H8/3002 core. Improves sound in Namco System 12 and ND-1 [cync].
- Fixed sound banking in Go Go! Mile Smile [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Major improvement to the YMF271 sound core [Ville Linde]:
  * Fixed timer A calculation;
  * Fixed note pitch calculation;
  * Added envelope generator;
  * Added stereo panning and fixed other volume calculations;
  * Added FM sound generation.
- Fixed crash in mystwarr games [R. Belmont].
- Figured out encryption key for Graplop (set 2) [MASH].
- Rewrote the configuration reader/writer code to be more generic and easier for other subsystems to plug into. This necessitated a rewrite of the way the existing code reads config data. As a result, your game.cfg files will be invalid after this update. Your default.cfg and existing controller- specific .cfg files should work fine [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed all the mystwarr.c games so they pass their service mode mask ROM tests, with the exception of Metamorphic Force (it gets hung up on the road generator ("LVC") test for some reason) [R. Belmont].
- Fixed Monster Bash (2-board version) so it works now, though the graphics are still not perfect [David Haywood, MASH].
- Turned off -fomit-frame-pointer in optimized builds. It was leading to crashes when used with setjmp/longjmp on Windows builds [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed tilemap priorities and sprites in Flying Tiger [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added green overlay to Meadows Lanes [MASH].
- Various improvements to the simple Deco 156 games [David Haywood]:
  * Modified video code to use the functions in deco16ic.c;
  * Changed Osman to default to 3 buttons as per Guru's eeprom dump.
- Namco System 22 update [R. Belmont]:
  * Hooked up MCU/CPU communications properly;
  * The MCU now reads the controls in Prop Cycle, Alpine Racer, and Cyber Cycles;
  * Sound effects and music are now present in all Super System 22 games.
