- Tidied up some minor things [Vas Crabb].
- skyarmy: Tweak clocks based on PCB video [hap].
- pci/zr36057.cpp: Hookup interrupt routing [Angelo Salese].
- zvt/pp01.cpp: Restrict drawing to clipping rectangle and cleaned up code (#13417) [cam900]:
  * Restore memory mapping after loading a saved state;
  * Reduced literal tags and run-time tag lookups;
  * Use more appropriate types and made some variables const.
- wing/pinkiri8.cpp: Fixed some issues and cleaned up code (#13412) [cam900]:

  * The code depends on getting away with trying to read at least one hunk past the end of the parent CHD. Previously it just ignored any errors from reading the parent CHD, but adding error checking broke it;
  * This hack just ignores that specific error. Also cleaned up some gross flow control and made more things const;
  * The code should obviously be fixed properly, but that's non-trivial. This gets it to a state no worse than it was in 0.270.

- cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Minor fixes and optimisations [Vas Crabb]:
  * Clear V/Z/S bits in flags register after SETFLGS or RESTORE. These flags are kept in the native NZCV register, and SAVE assumes the corresponding bits in the flags register are clear;
  * Don't use an extra temporary register for SETFMOD with operand loaded from memory. It doesn't allow additional parallelism anyway;
  * Slightly optimised generated code for GETFLGS;
  * Avoid a redundant TST when flags are requested for the non-optimised ROLAND case. Also avoid unnecessarily updating flags when not requested;
  * Don't update flags for ADD/ADDC/SUB/SUBB/AND if not requested. Slightly reduces pressure on the NZCV register;

- ddragon: Increase overall adpcm volume [hap].
- cpu/drcbearm64.cpp: Optimised conditional operations using carry flag (#13484) [Vas Crabb]:
  * Track the state of the native carry flag to avoid unnecessarily manipulating the native NZCV register. If the native carry flag does not correspond to the UML carry flag, test the bit in the flags register for the C and NC conditions;
  * Use condition select instructions to implement conditional forms of MOV and FMOV when advantageous;
  * Fixed EXIT with C/NC/A/BE condition not working properly if it doesn't immediately follow a CMP or SUB. Extended reach of conditional EXIT to +/-128MiB (was +/-1MiB for conditions other than U/NU);
  * Moved code to set up skipping conditional instructions to a common function;
  * Use TBZ/TBNZ for short backward jumps with U/NU/C/NC conditions to save one instruction and a temporary register;
  * Simplified/optimised ADD[C]/SUB[B] code generation - avoids an unnecessary register copy when one operand is in memory and the other is a small immediate value.  Also fixed another unnecessary register copy for SUB[B] when an operand is kept in a host register;
  * Slightly optimised generated code for AND immediate.
- Miscellaneous minor stuff [Vas Crabb]:
  * scripts/minimaws: Set option strict for JavaScript code;

 * cpu/drcbex64.cpp: Avoid loading CL when ECX can be used.  Loading CL doesn't clear the upper bits, so it depends on the previous value of RCX, causing pipeline dependencies. Loading ECX can grab a fresh rename register;

- Write the results of an ALU operation before writing to register/memory (#13486) [Matthew Daniels]:
  * Sega Rally has an instruction that calculates d += p and loads a value into d at the same time; it is the loaded value that should be used, not the result of the ALU operation;

- tatsumi: bulk replace screen_update suffixes, m_rotatingsprites -> m_sprites [Angelo Salese].
- igs/igs01.cpp: Dumped missing GFX ROM for xymga [little0].
- igs/spoker.cpp: Dumped missing GFX ROM for jinhulu2101is and cjdh6. Renamed cjdh6 to huahuas2a as it was misnamed [little0].
- igs/spoker.cpp: Implemented more tile banking bits following Haze's IGS033 implementation, gives correct GFX for the sets which use that chip without breaking the ones using the IGS001 / IGS002 combo [Ivan Vangelista].
- sinclair/spectrum.cpp: Improved performance by 50% avoiding memregion lookup in a critical path (#13508) [holub].
- dataeast/rohga.cpp: Add Wizard Fire (Over Sea v1.0) (#13495) [ClawGrip].
- Update sorcerer_cass.xml (#13480). Corrected developer names and added dates and publisher details for various titles [Michael Borthwick].
- Add a new Cadash Spanish set (#13461) [ClawGrip].
- Add a skeleton driver form AMS Optomax V image analyser (#13460) [ClawGrip].
- Add a Skeleton driver for Honeywell CAMIR-F1 motion sensor (#13441) [ClawGrip].
- Add a skeleton for Turnier Dart darts machine (#13437) [ClawGrip].
- capcom/gng.cpp: Add a new Ghosts'n Goblins bootleg (#13428) [ClawGrip].
- nec/pc80s13k.cpp: Sync pc88va2_fd_if_device with timer fixup from main driver [Angelo Salese].
- hash/pc88va.xml: Update QA [Angelo Salese].
- Add a skeleton for Microtek MICE-IIIS-68000 In-Circuit Emulator (#13393) [ClawGrip].
- Also renamed "Microtek International" to just "Microtek" as manufacturer name on the driver for older MICE models (the commercial brand was "Microtek", without any suffix) [ClawGrip].
- Add a skeleton for Microtek Powerpack In-Circuit Emulator PP-SW+ PIII (#13390) [ClawGrip].
- Add a skeleton driver for Secoinsa Serie 20 (#13381) [ClawGrip].
- misc/compucranes.cpp: Add a new crane coinop on GANCHONEW hardware (#13358) [ClawGrip].
- linn/linndrum.cpp: Emulating hi-hat decay (#13509) [m1macrophage]:
  * Hi-hat decay knob is now working;
  * Open and closed hats have different decays;
  * Better default tuning for the snare;
  * Removed `strobe_` prefix from functions where it was redundant. Made it an argument in a function where it matters.
- Create skeleton device for Sega Megalo 50 DASS and hook it on supported Sega C2 games [jordigahan, Recreativas.org] (#12401) [ClawGrip].
- cpu/e132xs: More recompiler optimisation [Vas Crabb]:
  * Made interrupt check function generate far more compact code (about 85% reduction in number of native instructions on x86-64);
  * Optimised out-of-cycles check;
  * Applied prior optimisation for trap/interrupt checks to static exception checks as well (code is still copy/pasted).
- cpu/e132xs: Fixed IO2 interrupt check in recompiler. Also further reduced conditional branches and logic operations in interrupt check [Vas Crabb].
- psion/psion.cpp: Consolidated into single file, and removed runtime tag lookups [Nigel Barnes]:
  * Simplified ROM/RAM banking;
  * Added Alpha and Numerical keyboards for POS variants;
  * Applied software list filters;
  * Added topslot for Organiser II variants;
  * Removed fake LZ64S model, ROMs moved to LZ64;
  - psion/psion_pack.cpp: Allow setting image_interface.
- srcclean the tree [Vas Crabb].
- src/devices/cpu/e132xs/e132xsdrc.cpp: Fixed regression in exceptions [Vas Crabb].
- Miscelaneous minor fixes [Vas Crabb]:
  * Changed "Exception Points" to "Exceptionpoints" in the debugger documentation and help. This better matches "Watchpoints" and "Registerpoints".  Also, it's very confusing that you see the help topic listing showing "Exception Points" but typing "help Exception Points" doesn't actually work;
  * cpu/e132xs: Fixed a flags issue in the recompiler;
  * misc/dgpix.cpp: Demoted The X-Files to not working with unemulated protection;
  * skeleton/turnierdart.cpp: The srcclean on this file was missed.
- misc/dgpix.cpp: Demote the correct game [Vas Crabb].
- Miscellaneous Fixes for descriptions [Vas Crabb].
