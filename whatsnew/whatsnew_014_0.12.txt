Program changes
---------------
- Sound support in Burger Time. This is the first multiple CPU game supported by MAME (two 6502, one for code, one for sound). It's not perfect, but we're getting there. Also, as you can guess, this is slow. A 486/100 cannot handle it at 60 fps. Runs reasonably with -frameskip 1, though [Nicola Salmoria].
- I also set up the second CPU to emulate sound in Scramble, but the sound that comes out is completely wrong. I don't know what I'm missing, anyone can help? [Nicola Salmoria].
- Since the 8910 emulator doesn't allow to set the clock frequency at runtime, I temporarily switched to using the default one. This affects sound in Crazy Climber, Crazy Kong and Bagman. Let me know whether it's better or worse than before [Nicola Salmoria].
- Sound in Centipede, through Ron Fries' POKEY emulator [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed speed in Burger Time (was running at about half the real speed) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Provided 288x224 video modes to be used with Rally X. WARNING: these video modes might be unstable (the noscanlines one hangs my system). Any help to make them better would be appreciated. As usual, if the default mode doesn't work on your system, try -noscanlines. If that doesn't work as well, use -vesa [Valerio Verrando].
- I finally found out what was causing slowdowns in Rally X and Bagman. It was an interrupt related issue (see later). I hope I didn't break a dozen of other games to fix this ;-) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Thanks to Mike Cuddy and Mirko Buffoni, Pooyan colors are now MUCH better ;-) I also fixed a bug in the dip switches. MAKE SURE TO DELETE POOYAN\POOYAN.DSW, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY [Mike Cuddy, Mirko Buffoni].
- I suddenly realized that Time Pilot runs on the same hardware as Pooyan, so I made a driver for it. Colors come straight from Mike Cuddy's emulator [Nicola Salmoria].
- Gary Walton confirms that the colors in Moon Cresta and Moon Quasar are 100 accurate. Very good! [Gary Walton].
- The background stars in Scramble/Super Cobra now blink. However I don't know how close to the real thing it is [Nicola Salmoria].
- Pointed out that The End runs on Scramble hardware, so it now uses the same driver. He also fixed problems with the input controls and two players modes. IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO DELETE THE FILES SCRAMBLE\SCRAMBLE.DSW AND THEEND\THEEND.DSW, OTHERWISE THE GAMES WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY [Ville Laitinen].
- Also fixed sprite priorities in Congo Bongo [Ville Laitinen].
- Provided the color PROMs for Crazy Kong, so colors are now 100% accurate (with the possible exception of Kong itself, which uses a separate palette) [Doug Jefferys].
- Support for Moon Ranger (bootleg version of Moon Patrol) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added support for Lost Tomb (Stern game running on Super Cobra hardware), but it doesn't work well (crashes during the demo, and it's not playable) and the graphics are garbled. I think some of the ROMs might be corrupted [Nicola Salmoria].
- Preliminary support for Jump Bug. It uses a modified Scramble driver, the hardware seems to be similar. It's not playable (the input bits are not even mapped), and resets after a few seconds. I'm not particularly interested in this game, anyone volunteers to complete the driver? [Nicola Salmoria].
- Support for the version of Super Cobra with Stern copyright. NOTE THAT I RENAMED THE OTHER ONE (Konami copyright) (scobrak) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Provided a Millipede driver (DIP switches are not supported yet). Sound doesn't work, I don't know why [Ivan Mackintosh].
- Provided a preliminary version of the Mr. Do's Castle driver. Not working yet! [Brad Oliver].
- Pointed out that Carnival uses a RAM for character generation (like Nibbler) and provided a driver for it. It's still not playable, but the graphics are now correct [Mike Coates].
- Suggested to add a new option: "-vesascan". It uses a VESA 800x600 screen to simulate scanlines. It is much slower than the other video modes. Use this if you want scanlines and the default video mode doesn't work [Bernd Wiebelt].


Source changes:
---------------
- Multiple CPU support. All you have to do to setup multiple CPUs is add entries to the cpu[] array in the MachineDriver definition. Each CPU can have different type (currently Z80 and M6503 are supported), clock, address space, memory/IO port hook, interrupt handlers, number of interrupts per video frame [Nicola Salmoria].
- Sometimes interrupt requests happen while interrupts are disabled. Until now I just ignored them, but some games need them to be processed as soon as interrupts are reenabled. Rally X is an example of such a game. The Z80 engine has provision to do that, but it would make writing a driver more complex (need to find the interrupt acknowledge register) so I slightly modified the engine to automatically cache an interrupt request and execute it as soon as interrupts are enabled. I had already done a similar change to the 6502 engine, it was needed by Burger Time which wouldn't accept coins otherwise [Nicola Salmoria].
- Since the functions xxx_vh_start(), xxx_vh_stop(), xxx_videoram_w(), xxx_colorram_w() are the same for most video drivers, I moved them, alongside with some variables, to vidhrdw/generic.c. This doesn't reduce much the size of the executable, but greatly reduces the amount of code that has to be put in a video driver (in many cases, you just have to write xxx_vh_screenrefresh()) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed bug in msdos.c/osd_play_streamed_sampled() which prevented it from handling more than one audio stream. This part of the code still needs a major cleanup [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed bug in drawgfx() which sometimes allowed transparent non remapped copies to be drawn outside of the clip region [Nicola Salmoria].
