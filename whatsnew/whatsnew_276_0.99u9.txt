Magic Bubble (Adult version) [David Haywood]
Dynamite Dux (set 1, 8751 317-0095) [Arzeno Fabrice, David Haywood]


Source changes:
---------------
- Removed tilemap_dispose call and fixed the two drivers that were using it. This fixes improper save state registrations in megasys1 and ygv608 games [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug that caused the sound cores to keep running while paused [Aaron Giles].
- Added discrete emulation of the background music for 'Indian Battle' [Derrick Renaud].
- Fixed tilemap priorities in 'Magic Bubble' [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Cleaned up MESS hooks into the input port system [Nathan Woods].
- Major Namco sound improvements [R. Belmont]:
  * C352 now sets output pitch correctly by input clock.
  * Added emulated sound and music to all NB-1, NB-2, and System 11 games, using Prop Cycle's BIOS as a substitute until the original can be trojaned or otherwise obtained.
  * Hooked it up for plain System 22 games as well, but they're not interested in passing down proper commands for some reason.
  * Speed-cheated all instances of the M37710/C352 sound system so CPU requirements don't go up much. This also helped back off the requirements a hair for 'Prop Cycle' and 'Time Crisis'.
