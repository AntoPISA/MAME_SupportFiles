Source changes:
----------------------
- Big 80s Namco update (this affects the first Namco games that used custom I/O chips) [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * These files are no longer needed and should be removed: drivers/bosco.c, drivers/xevious.c, drivers/digdug.c, machine/digdug.c, machine/galaga.c, machine/bosco.c, machine/polepos.c, sndhrdw/bosco.c.
  * Added three new sound chips: NAMCO_15XX, NAMCO_52XX, NAMCO_54XX, and changed drivers to use them (NAMCO_54XX is just a placeholder playing
  samples, until the chip is reverse engineered).
  * MAME testers bugs fixed: digdug063gre, galaga057gre, bosco071u2gre, poleposc059gra.
  * Added EAROM support to digdug.
  * Fixed the polepos2 title screen which had been broken since day 1, strange that nobody noticed.
  * Fixed various mistakes in the polepos ROM loading (one missing speech ROM in polepos,  polepos2 was using the wrong engine sound ROMs (it's turbo!),
  added missing vertical scaling PROMs).
  * Extensive documentation of ROM names and placement, and differences between Namco and licensed versions.
  * Converted all drivers to tilemaps, and made gfx emulation more accurate according to schematics.
  * polepos sprite zooming should now be closer to the hardware.
  * IP_KEY_PREVIOUS and IP_JOY_PREVIOUS are no longer used by any driver: they may be removed from the core.
  * Support for start lamps, coin counters and coin lockout (all internallyhandled by the custom I/O chip).
  * Toggling the test switch while the game is running enters test mode without need to manually reset.
  * Found and documented test mode Easter eggs in all games except 'Xevious'.
  * 'Bosconian' now uses a different sound PROM, which seems more correct.
  * 'Galaga' uses better dumps of the PROMs, with the unused top 4 bits set to 0.
  * Correct handling of 52XX sample start/end pointers in ROM.
  * Better emulation of 50XX custom, no more need for hacks in 'Bosconian'.
  * Swapped digdug and digdugb, the main set should be the newer one.
  * Removed these galaga clones: nebulbee (copyright/name change), galagab2 (mix 'n match of ROMs from other sets), galaga84 (copyright/gfx change),   galagads (1-byte hack to get fast shoot, reproducible with this line in cheat.dat: galaga:1:070D:0D:100:Fast Shoot).
  * Added 'Galaga rev. B', which is now the main set, renamed the other galagao.
  * Added galagamk, a different Midway version.
  * Removed various bad dumps from polepos2b and poleps2c, they turned out to be the same version so poleps2c is removed.
  * drivers/locomotn.c is no longer needed and should be removed.
  * Converted to tilemaps, consolidated as much as I could.
  * Fixed: jungler37b3gre error.
  * Correct tile/sprite priority handling (also in 'Bosconian').
  * Documented the easter egg in 'Rally X'.
  * Added starfield in 'Tactician'.
  * Fixed the RC filter control in the games with Konami sound.
- Big Namco NB1 update [Phil Stroffolino]:
  * Various improvements for System NB emulation, including: new driver: Greatest Slugger '93 (Japan), hardware shadow support (used heavily in Greatest Slugger), dedicated random number generator chip, sprite stretch glitch (affects Outfoxies intro), tilemap tile banking feature (used by Mach Breakers), removed several game-specific hacks; now uses dedicated CPU registers for interrupts. Preliminary support for screen blanking (hides garbage in Outfoxies). Proper POSIRQ handling, for scanline effects. Fixes the watereffects in Outfoxies.  This same feature needs to be folded into System 2 emulation, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. Various Mach Breaker-specific hacks for interpretting the ROZ layer registers; these aren't yet fully understood.  In particular, the "Monster Pull" stage is missing a "3d floor."
