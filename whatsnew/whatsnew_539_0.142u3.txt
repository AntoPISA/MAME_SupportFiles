- Fixed i86/i386 POP SP and POP ESP thanks to bug report for Xenix boot by bs666 [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Collapsed device_config and device_t into one class. Updated all existing modern devices and the legacy wrappers to work in this environment. This in general greatly simplifies writing a modern device [Aaron Giles].
- psx.c: adjusted MDEC timing to avoid lockups. Most FMVs now have fluent video [R. Belmont].
- Fixed Z80STI interrupts [Curt Coder].
- Fixed I8255 interrupt enable [Curt Coder].
- Fixed reset register bit masks in RP5C01 and RP5C15 [Curt Coder].

- Naomi/Triforce/Chihiro documentation update [f205v].
- Fixed protection read-back registers 0x07 and 0x0e / 0x0f in k051733 math chip, finally fixing gameplay issues in Chequered Flag [Angelo Salese].
- konamigv: Documentation updates [Guru].
- diimage.c: Fix uninitialized variables found by Valgrind [R. Belmont].

- Removed cheesy hack to F1 GP Star 2 IRQ communications [Angelo Salese].
- Fix second adpcm player in games using SEIBU_ADPCM [R. Belmont].
- Made k051733 RNG to behave like an adder, improves pseudo-random events in Fast Lane [Angelo Salese].
- Tentative experiment for Hot Chase gameplay speed... still not perfect though (especially noticeable with sound) [Angelo Salese].
- Reimplemented devcb using delegates and classes. Unified the logic for identifying targets and simplified the code [Aaron Giles].
- naomi: Abstract the maple and jvs interfaces into a set of devices [O. Galibert, MetalliC, Tormod, D. Knute].
- Started unifying sprite implementations for setax001/x002 chips [David Haywood].
- drcbex64: Fix op_debug implementation [Olivier Galibert].
- Add Puzznic MCU dump and added a PAL as NO_DUMP. The MCU still needs to be properly hooked up [Smitdogg, The Dumping Union, Lord Nightmare].
- naomi: Add jvs command 0x32, fixes Crazy Taxi and Virtua Tennis 2 booting [Olivier Galibert].
- Added input button labels for Midway T-Unit driver [Joe Caporale].
- De-stateized the NB1414M4 routines, and converted the correlated Armed F text tilemap to be 8-bits [Angelo Salese].
- Hooked up NB1414M4 to Ninja Emaki, greatly improving gfxs in it [Angelo Salese].
- Implemented serial type scrolling for Youma Ninpou Chou bootlegs [Angelo Salese].
- Support for dynamic devices added to the core [Miodrag Milanovic]:
  * Added slot and slot card interfaces;
  * Added SLOT_INTERFACE macros in order to simplify device adding;
  * Added new menu option "Slot Devices" and support to change device in runtime;
  * Updated emuopts to support command setting of slot cards.
- Update clifront and added listslots option to display available slots and device options for each one [Miodrag Milanovic].
- mpu4.c: Started adding support for the Crystal Gaming program card, and the link keys for setting parameters [J Wallace].
- 6840ptm.c: Fixed mode check in set_gate() [J Wallace].
- srcclean.c: srcclean should remove invalid chars only for source files which are not xml (softlists have UTF-8 characters) [Fabio Priuli].
- Hooked up proper sound program in Combat School bootleg [Angelo Salese].
- Moved format handling and all formats to separate library [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Converted PlayStation DMA to an internal device to the CPU core. DMA to external devices can be set in the machine config, the old calls are still there until the rest of the code is converted [smf].
- Added support for default NVRAM in MCCS1850 [Curt Coder].
- Various Irem M92/M107 fixes [Alex Jackson]:
  * Hooked up sound CPU interrupts properly, using the V35 builtin interrupt controller, rather than generating the vectors in the driver;
  * Cleaned up ROM mirroring, using AM_REGION macros in the address maps instead of memcpy()ing all over the place in the DRIVER_INITs;
  * Converted bankswitching to use configured banks. Only configure the banks and install the bankswitch WRITE_HANDLER in the games that actually use it (i.e. those with a full megabyte of program ROM). This and the previous change make the drivers a lot less confusing to look at... I hope;
  * Converted both drivers to use a scanline timer device instead of a hand-rolled one;
  * Added save state support to m92.c. Everything necessary was already saved, I just had to add the tag. However, presumably due to the core emu_timer breakage (MT 4330, 4331) the save states don't actually work at the moment. I've already reported this as MT #4333;
  * Added GAME_MECHANICAL tag to wpksoc and clone.
- Converted Ginga Ninkyouden to use proper 6840 PTM device [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed missing sprite regression in the Wiz driver [Angelo Salese].
- chdman: Handle track type 6 in .nrg files [R. Belmont].
- Compile fix for kFreeBSD [Christian Marillat].
