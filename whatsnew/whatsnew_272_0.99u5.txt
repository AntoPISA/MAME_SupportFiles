Source changes:
---------------
- Completed renaming of core structures. Most pervasive change was "struct tilemap" is now just "tilemap" [Aaron Giles].
- Added save state support to the Cinematronics vector games [Buddabing].
- Added blending to the alt tilemap code in psikyosh.c, fixing the final boss in 'Sol Divide' [David Haywood].
- Improvements to the 'Witch/Pinball Champ '95' driver [Sebasten Hegon]:
  * The games now show some graphics (the palette seems OK) and play some music and sounds.
  * Since the controls are not yet figured out completely, they are still mapped as dipswitches.
  * An NVRAM reset is required the first time you launch Witch (via the associated dipswitch). 'Pinball Champ' seems to automatically do this.
  * The sound part required some patching in sound/es8712.c. I disabled the hardcoded inconditional looping, and made the sound start when writing at offset 0x06 (cf patch). vmetal does not seem to be affected.
  * As far as gameplay is concerned, the ball will freeze (in game and demo mode), and I don't know why. The video hardware is not completely figured out and may be the culprit.
  * The coin in/out mecanism needs some work too.
- Some improvements to 'Jolly Card' [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added extra hardware info (pinouts and dips).
  * Added the correct dipswitch to Jolly Card. Hopper and Points/pulse not tested due to preliminary driver state. The rest are working properly. Remember to delete the NVRAM and reinitialize to see some changes.
  * Added almost the same dipswitch to 'Magic Card II (Bulgaria)'.
- Significant changes to the save state system [Aaron Giles]:
  * Added alternate save state pre-/post-load function types that take integer or pointer parameters. Updated several sound cores and other files to take advantage of this.
  * Made state handler registrations track like other scoped resources (timers, memory) so that registrations can occur as late as MACHINE_INIT time.
  * Added logic to detect registrations after MACHINE_INIT time and prevent saves in that case.
  * Added logic to detect when CPUs or sound chips haven't registered anything to save/load. When this happens, info is logged to error.log and saves/loads are disallowed.
  * Allocated timers are now automatically saved and restored as part of the save state. The global time is now restored as well as a bunch of CPU execution state. This should produce more reliable restores.
  * Added logic to defer saves until all anonymous timers have cleared. If a driver uses many anonymous timers it may not be possible to ever  successfully save, so the operation will time out after one second.
  * Before restoring, the machine is now reset. This gives a more consistent environment for the load to occur.
  * Re-enabled save state support for YM2151.
  * Added save state support to the classic Namco sound system.
  * Added save state support to the samples sound system.
  * Removed anonymous timer usage in machine/scramble.c.
