---------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE TO OSD DEVELOPERS: As of this release, you are now required to make use of options.c to set core options. At a minimum, this requires calling options_init(NULL) before calling run_game().

Source changes:
---------------
- Improved DIP switches in the yunsun16 driver and added more documentation [stephh].
- Improved timer accuracy and added save state support to the 6526 CIA module [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed bug in memory map dumping code that caused wrong addresses to be dumped [Wilbert Pol].
- Connected TMS5220 speech support to the Major Havoc: Return to Vax mod [Jess Askey].
- Changed comment shortcut in disassembly windows to avoid clash with Ctrl+C for "Copy" [Nathan Woods].
- Added checking for register symbol names to ensure they aren't numeric (which prevents their identification by the expression parser). Changed the M4510 CPU symbols to avoid tripping this check [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed crash in the Win32 debugger code with small window sizes [Samuele Zannoli].
- Fixed assertion when auditing systems with no samples or ROMs [Nathan Woods].
- Some pmpoker driver improvements [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added service/settings mode to pmpoker.
  * Added PORT_IMPULSE to manage correct timings for most inputs in all games.
- Fixed "run to cursor" functionality for CPUs that had an address bus shift [Andrew Gardner].
- Fixed bug that caused false positive ZIP filename matches [Aaron Giles].
- Added PATH_SEPARATOR define so that platforms with non forward-slash path separators can get preassembled paths in their native format [Aaron Giles].
- Some enhancements to the options manager [Aaron Giles]:
  * Added a simpler options_init for startup.
  * Added support for internal options.
  * Added support for multiple unadorned options.
  * Moved core options definitions into the core options.c (note that the default INI path no longer includes $HOME/.mame since that is not cross-platform; *nix platforms will need to explicitly override that default in their OSD code)
  * Added accessor to set the default value of a given option.
  * Changed error reporting so that errors are tracked internally  and reported only once.
- Improved documentation in osdepend.h to better describe some of the functions and provide a general overview of how things work. Removed unused osd_readkey_unicode function [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug in the bilinear software scaler that would read out of bounds on a bitmap [Aaron Giles].
- Added supervisor DAC support to the Max-a-Flex driver [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed clock speeds on Turbo/Buck Rogers [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed -romident with ZIP files [Aaron Giles].
