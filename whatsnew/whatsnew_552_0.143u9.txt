-----------------------------------------


New Clone Added
---------------
Battle Shark (Japan, Joystick) [ShouTime]


MAME Testers Bugs Fixed (2)
---------------------------
- 04509: [Core] Analog controls are broken on keyboard when joystick is enabled (Alex Jackson)
- 04394: [DIP/Input] All games with paddle inputs: IPT_PADDLE inputs do not center properly when mapped to an analog joystick (Alex Jackson)


Source changes:
---------------
- Fix listing of switches used by gambling games [kanikani].
- Hooked up MC6845 to Laser Base [Angelo Salese].
- Hooked up PIT to Laser Base [Angelo Salese, Tomasz Slanina].
- Changed some of the default mappings for analog controls in order to fix various input-fighting bugs (including, but not limited to, MT#4394 and MT#4509). Reverted the u8 change to analog joystick handling--it only partially solved the problem it was meant to fix, it introduced new issues in return, and generally made the code more complicated for little benefit [Alex Jackson].
- Improved game documentation to Naomi / Triforce / Chihiro HW [f205v].
