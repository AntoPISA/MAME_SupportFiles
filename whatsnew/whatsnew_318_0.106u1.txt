0.106u1 2006/05/18 [#318 - Aaron Giles]
---------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE: Major video-related changes are beginning in the system. Attempts will be made to keep the existing video code working to a large degree, but some features may be broken or working improperly until the video changes are complete. Most notably, in this release, RGB effects are broken for non-Direct3D blitting. For the moment, do not report anomalies or problems in the video system. If you like a nice, stable MAME, please stick with the 0.106 release. You have been warned.


MAMETesters Bug Fixed (1):
--------------------------
gladiatr0105u4gra (Don Maeby)


Source changes:
---------------
- Updates to the taito_x driver [AWJ]:
  * Fixed sound problems in twinhawk.
  * Fixed a couple of dipswitch mistakes introduced recently.
  * Added PORT_DIPLOCATIONs for superman and twinhawk.
- Improved MSVC compiler support [Nathan Woods]:
  * Modified vconv to support multiple versions of MSVC based on version info.
  * Added support for more parameter translations.
  * makefile now displays compiling and linking messages when building vconv.
- Converted the Windows blitters to use the DRC engine for generation. RGB effects are officially broken with this change [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed a bug that caused a crash when the -debugscript command line option was used with an invalid filename [Nathan Woods].
- Corrected the ordering of the DIP_PORTLOCATION() macros to be consistent. Multi-bit DIP switches should be specified in LSB-first order. Added a comment to this effect in inptport.h [AWJ, Aaron Giles].
- Fixed background color in the Deco cassette games [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed potential crash in the micro3d driver [MamePlus!].
- Improvements to CHD-CD support [R. Belmont]:
  * Additional RAW CD sector conversion support, so a game can request e.g. 2048-byte data sectors from a RAW CHD-CD and still get the right data.
  * Reversed CHDMAN error message - now non-RAW CHD-CDs are deprecated.
  * susume now uses a RAW CHD-CD read directly from an original pressed Konami disc.
- Some improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver [Andrew Gardner]:
  * Adds change_PC() calls to the dsp56k core
 - removed hacky dsp56k initialization, enabling, and disabling.
  * Added preliminary implementation of banking hardware tied to the dsp56k in Polygonet Commanders.
- Fixed MSB accesses and latch reading in the 6840 emulator [El Condor].
- Improved N64 audio output [R. Belmont]:
  * Rewrote Audio Interface as a stereo DMADAC (which it actually is), greatly simplifying the code along the way.
  * Fixed AI interrupt semantics.
- Changed a number of games that were incorrectly using IPT_LIGHTGUN to use IPT_AD_STICK instead [Aaron Giles].
- Some preparations for proper multiple screen support. The visible_area and refresh_rate values in the machine structure are now defined as arrays (1 per screen). The machine_config structure has been altered as well, removing the following fields:

  frames_per_second
  aspect_x, aspect_y
  screen_width, screen_height
  default_visible_area
  vblank_duration

  These are all stored per-screen in a new screen_config structure [Aaron Giles].
- Reorganized the user interface code to better support the new render system [Aaron Giles].
