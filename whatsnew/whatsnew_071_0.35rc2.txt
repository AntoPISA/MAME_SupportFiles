Source changes:
----------------------
- Added rotary control support to 'Top Gunner'. This works in topgunbl *only* - the gun turret cannot be rotated in jackal and topgunr, those games don't support the rotary joystick [Karl Stenerud].
- Added scroll to 'Pinball Action' when you push button 4, but I'm not sure it's correct [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed crashes in 'Demon', added analog controls to 'Tailgunner', fixed reset bug in 'Space Wars', added glove control to 'Boxing Bugs', added color to 'War of the Worlds' and 'Boxing Bugs' (seems to be wrong compared to Retrocade) [Mathis Rosenhauer].
- Fixed the slapstic emulation in 'Gauntlet', 'Gauntlet II', 'Xybots', 'Empire Strikes Back', 'Rampart' [Ernesto Corvi, Nicola Salmoria].
- IMPORTANT FOR PORTERS: the "safety area" allocated by osd_new_bitmap() must now be 16 pixels instead of 8. This is required by the NeoGeo driver [Nicola Salmoria].
- Incresed the horizontal resolution for NeoGeo to 320. This looks strange with some games, but it is definitely the correct value as I verified it on the real thing. Games like 'Puzzle Bobble' and 'Baseball Stars' use the extra area, while most of the other games draw just two bars in there. If a game looks odd, adjust your monitor to send the extra area offscreen [Nicola Salmoria].
- Simplified the error message when ROMs are missing. It now gives a list of all the missing ROMs, it doesn't stop at the first one [Nicola Salmoria].
