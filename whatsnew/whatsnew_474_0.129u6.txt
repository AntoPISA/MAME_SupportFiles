Source changes:
---------------
- Added built-in layouts for a large number of games: 280zzzap, buggyboy, buggychl, cbombers, changela, chasehq, chqflag, contcirc, dblaxle, finallap, grchamp, hotchase, lagunar, outrun, overdriv, pdrift, polepos, radr, roundup5, sci, slipstrm, stocker, superchs, topspeed, toutrun, turbotag, tx1, wecleman [Mr. Do!].
- Merged memory maps in nemesis.c [Aaron Giles].
- Scramble now is a lot closer to reports and recordings (background sound, sound of bullets [Couriersud].
- Fixed descriptions of the games running on NAOMI series hardware, and NAOMI game list [Yasuhiro Ogawa].
- Input ports clean-up for the jangou driver [Angelo Salese].
- Finally low pass filtering on channel 2A in btime driver [Couriersud]:
  * Changed resistor to bill of material value.
  * Adjusted volume level and added more documentation.
- Fixed regression (missing graphics) in ipminvad (m10) [Couriersud].
- Added support for System 24 tilemap linescroll modes [Olivier Galibert].
- Various improvements to 'Heavy Unit' [Angelo Salese, Tomasz Slanina, David Haywood]:
  * Added a VERY preliminary simulation of the protection, just enough to get the game to boot, not make it playable
  * Corrected CPU communication, IRQ/NMI generation etc.
  * Fixed some video emulation issues (added tilemap scroll etc.)
  * Corrected GFX ROM loading (at least for the graphics used in attract mode).
- Fixed King Derby sprite colors [Stefan Lindberg, Angelo Salese].
- Merged tetrisp2 memory maps. Renamed (teplus2) to (tetrisp2j) [Aaron Giles].
- Merged labyrunr memory maps [Phil Bennett].
- Added GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS to Tutankham and clones [Couriersud].
- Hooked up layer enables in goldstar.c driver, fixes 'girl' in 'Cherry Master' [David Haywood].
- Scaled up renegade and mjkjidai ADPCM levels in line with recent clock_adpcm() change [Phil Bennett].
- Converted all drivers to the new device-based 6821 PIA [Aaron Giles].
- Added new function memory_install_read_port_handler( to more easily allow you to install read handlers for ports based on tag [Aaron Giles].
- Removed input_port_read_handler8/16/32/64 functions, since they were really only used for getting a memory handler for a port by tag, and this is no longer necessary [Aaron Giles].
- Moved input port handlers to internal code in the memory system [Aaron Giles].
- Added port names to the taito8741 device pending its proper devicification [Aaron Giles].
- Removed all remaining uses of input_port_n_r() functions, and purged them from src/emu/machine/generic [Aaron Giles].
- Removed device types from device queries that use tags, under the assumption that all device tags are unique. Specifically, the following no longer need to provide a device type:
  AM_DEVREAD/WRITE
  DEVCB_DEVICE_HANDLER
  devtag_get_device
  devtag_reset
  device_list_find_by_tag
  as well as several device interfaces that referenced other devices [Aaron Giles].
- Moved SH2 set info functions to direct calls [Aaron Giles].
- Various improvements to the 'Zero Target' and 'Counter Steer' HW and cleaned-up the driver. Fixed foreground & background colors and hand-tuned sound in 'Zero Target' based on a side-by-side test. Fixed sprite colors [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed pedals in 'Final Lap 3' [Phil Bennett].
- Hooked up correct C75 MCU in namcofl.c (based on RB's namconb1.c implementation) [Phil Bennett].
- Corrected Dip-Switch settings for 'Zero Target' [Yasuhiro Ogawa, Angelo Salese].
- maketms: Free strings on exit. [Olivier Galibert]
- tms57002: Don't abort on unimplemented instructions [Olivier Galibert].
- Changed EEPROM erase command to write 0xff values [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed handling of corrupt archives [Couriersud]:
  * Corrupt files in archives now generate an error.
  * Archive files ending in "/" will not be tested for crc - skip path entries.
  * Add new flag FILE_OPEN_NO_PRELOAD to skip decompressing on open. This is used in audit.c, which only tests whether files exist
  * Added error checking to all calls to load_file_zipped.
- Added flags to the CHD metadata entries, encoded in the top bit. Right now it is a no-op, but eventually will be used to indicate which bits of metadata are included in the overall checksum [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed gcc 4.4 compilation error [Belegdol].
- Fixed auditing of ROM-less systems (for MESS [Rene Reucher].
- Another round of static/const qualifier additions, plus a rename of has_addon_chip to snes_has_addon_chip. Notably a number of z80ctc_interface are now const (devicification must have removed the cases where it was dynamically modified) [Atari Ace].
- Added the correct gfx roms to jjsquawkers bootleg [David Haywood].
- sfbonus version cleanups part 1 [David Haywood].
