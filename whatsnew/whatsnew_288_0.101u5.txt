Source changes:
---------------
- Added a FIFO for the sound commands in Sega Model 1 driver so they no longer get lost at startup. Fixed the CPU speed of the 68000 [R. Belmont].
- Added conditional dip switches and a missing dip switch to excelsr [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added very experimental rasterizer generator for the Voodoo emulator, which generates X86 assembly blitters optimized for each case. Unfortunately, it doesn't help performance much and they are still too buggy so they are disabled for now. Enable them in the makefile [Aaron Giles].
- Changed the AM_REGION() macro to store region/offset information instead of a pointer to simplify some of the region valdation code [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed 6805 core so that CLRA does not modify the carry flag [Ernesto Corvi].
- Fixed J. League protection workarounds so they work for 2 player games as well. Also fixed sonic so it works as well as the prototype version (still major graphics issues) [anonymous].
- Fixed sprites wrap around in st0016 (needed in nratechu) [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Implemented several missing features in the Namco NA sound emulator [cync].
- Made some of the hack optimizations runtime enableable in the Voodoo emulator, and added a frameskipper. Use Ctrl+1-6 to control frameskipping, Ctrl+F/H/Q to run at full/half/quarter resolution [Aaron Giles].
- Marked several large arrays properly as const [Atari Ace].
- Model 3 update [Ville Linde]:
  * Added Daytona USA 2 Power Edition
  * Huge update to the video hardware, including:
  - Transparency support (polygons and textures)
  - Nearly perfect rendering order (something never got right in: Supermodel :-)
  - Parallel lighting.
  - Texture coordinate mirroring.
- Rewrote most of the validity checks so the full set now completes in well under 1 second, minus I/O time from paging in data. Also added region size checking versus memory maps to the validity checks. Moved all validity checks to a new file validity.c [Aaron Giles].
- Several fixes and improvements to the C352 sound emulator [hoot development team].
