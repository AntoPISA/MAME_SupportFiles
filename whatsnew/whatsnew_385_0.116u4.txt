---------------------------
- kinst0116u3gra [Zsolt Vasvari]


Source changes:
---------------
- Changed system1 driver back to using SN7489A [Lord Nightmare].
- Fixed the road graphics, fixed the rest of the missing gfx, added collision detection, and added save states to the changela driver. Also fixed the colors [Adam Bousley].
- Changed all drivers to use the mame_timer_* calls. Deprecated the old double-based timer calls [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Changes the last few instances of rand() to mame_rand() and added a #define to prevent it from being used again [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Made many of the static info_list*() functions in clifront.c public [Dave Dribin].
- Fixed regression crashes in maxaflex.c, megadriv.c, monzagp.c, tetriunk.c, and gticlub.c [Atari Ace].
- Some more TIA graphics and sound improvements [Wilbert Pol]:
  * INPT4 and INPT5 are now read when needed instead of by a timed function. This removes the need for the tia_init_pal function;
  * Improved handling of the HMOVE functionality;
  * Added code to reduce the flickering caused by some Atari 2600 games;
  * Improved the sound poly generation;
  * Improved the handling of POLY5_DIV3 sound mode.
- Updated djboy driver [Phil Stroffolino]:
  * Support for djboyj; same MCU, but ROM banking bits need to be XOR'd;
  * Fixed state handling for game over/win transitions;
  * Fixes for DIP switches;
  * Added coinage support.
- Fixed a few places where driver code was not properly hooked up. Most cases were benign, but in a couple of instances, save state support was disconnected, and in one case it fixes a potential crash [Atari Ace].
- Fixed regression in "Space Raider" [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Improved frameskip behavior in the Gaelco 3d driver [Couriersud].
- Fixed palette regression in warpwarp/geebee [Atari Ace].
- Added support to chdman to cope with toc files created with cue2toc [smf].
- CPS3 updates [David Haywood, ElSemi]:
  * Corrected Clock speed, used idle skipping instead of reducing the clock speed;
  * Optimized some GFX functions. It now only decodes RAM based tiles when it needs to draw them, not every single time the data changes;
  * Added support for CD flashing;
  * Added support for alternate BIOS sets;
  * Changed code to use a custom render function.
- Found a number of additional encrypted opcodes for gussun [robiza].
- Simplified the internal handling of BIOS sets. Instead of there being an extra structure, the BIOS information is now embedded in the ROM definition for each BIOS [Atari Ace].
- Fixed 2nd player inputs in "Millipede" [Mike Haaland].
- Fixed crash in evilngt due to missing CD image [R. Belmont].
- Fixed crash in cfarm/cclown due to out-of-bounds parameter [R. Belmont].
- Added stricter checking in cdrom.c to prevent crashes in games when no CD-ROM is present [R. Belmont].
- Fixed regressions in dkongjr and pestplce due to incorrect memory map and rendering too many sprites [Couriersud].
- Fixed SUBTARGET=tiny builds [neoforma].
- Hooked up P1 joystick inputs for P2 in Upright mode in a number of black & white 8080 games. Removed cocktail settings for games where it is not appropriate. Enabled dual player game in spclaser [Mike Haaland].
- x64 compilation fixes [Oliver Stoneberg]:
  * Some VS2005 x64 warning fixes;
  * Enables the x64 porting warnings in VS2005;
  * Adds win_create_window_ex_utf8() to get rid of some tstring_from_utf8() usage;
  * Removed win_extract_icon_utf8().
- Improved color decoding in Irem M62 games [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Synchronized MAME and AGEMAME versions of the MPU4 code. Improved Connect4 layout. Simplified much of the code [James Wallace, Atari Ace].
- Improved the 6532riot timer implementation. Implemented irq callback support [Wilbert Pol].
- Updates to the minx CPU core [Wilbert Pol]:
  * Fixed TEST (94,95,96, and 97) instructions;
  * Fixed 2 MOV instructions (BE and BF);
  * Fixed one AND instruction (DC).
- Simplified interrupt handling in the z80gb core [Wilbert Pol].
- Hooked up lamps in Afterburner 2 driver [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed missing sound in PGM games [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed Millipede sprites in cocktail mode [Mike Haaland].
- Fixed behavior of the RC filter in (ddrible) and (ironhors) [Couriersud].
- Added wrap around x for sprites in the m92 driver [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
