MAMETesters Bugs Fixed (3):
---------------------------
- 04027: [Crash/Freeze] All sets in 20pacgal.c: Game does not successfully boot (Aaron Giles)

Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed problems with i2cmem. Cubo CD32 games now save and load settings properly [Mariusz Wojcieszek].
- Cleaned up many duplicate inputs and fixed others in a number of drivers [Tafoid].
- SDL: Support -uifont for using arbitrary TrueType fonts on Linux/BSD builds. This takes full pathname/filename to the font, and the name can have styles appended as in Windows: [b] for bold, [i] for italic, [s] for strikethrough, and [u] for underlined. Fonts are rendered at a size of 120 points and scaled down by the core, which looks superb on high-res displays. (Liberation Sans that comes with most recent distros looks really good). Warning: Linux/BSD builds now require SDL_ttf 2.x. On Fedora the required package names are "SDL_ttf" and "SDL_ttf-devel" [R. Belmont].
- tms7000: Corrected two opcodes: typo in inv_b and JPZ was wrong in official TI document [Gilles Fetis].
- SDL: -uifont now can also look up system font families like Windows [R. Belmont].
- Take some driver_device classes that cover multiple drivers and split them so that each driver gets their own driver_device class. In most cases, these drivers got entangled because of audio/mcu code that was shared between multiple drivers [Atari Ace]:
  * espial/marineb/zodiak
  - common code duplicated
  * m52/m57/m58/m62/travrusa
  - common code in audio/irem.c
  * junofrst/pooyan/rallyx/rocnrope/timeplt/tutankm
  - common code in audio/timeplt.c
  * hyperspt/sbasketb/trackfld/yiear
  - common code in audio/trackfld and audio/hyprolyb.c
  * 40love/bking/buggychl/msisaac
  - common code in machine/buggychl.c
- SDL: OS X support for -uifont [Tim Lindner].
- SDL: Build fixes for Ubuntu, -uifont non-ASCII rendering fix [R. Belmont, Barry Rodewald].
- SDL: Mac compile warning fix [Wilbert Pol].
- Added bare bones irq support to V810 CPU [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Updated Naomi's M2/M3 decryption. On the fly decryption of Virtua Striker III is now possible [Andreas Naive].
- Fixed interrupt handing in V810 core,and flag position in PCW [Miodrag Milanovic].
- SDL: add ptty (*IX/OS X) and sockets (all SDL builds) capability [Tim Lindner, R. Belmont].
- Added Button 3 to the original Yie Ar Kung-Fu boardsets. While not shown in manual, there is function for these buttons and the emulation should account for this possibility. Mapping is off by default [Tafoid].
- CPS-1 updates [Team CPS-1]:
  * Added The King of Dragons (World 910805) and set as new parent.
  * Minor cleanups and fixes.
  * Added Mega Man: The Power Battle (CPS1, USA 951006) and set as new parent.
  * Fixed slammast, slammastu labels, added D-Board PALs and PCB infos.
  * Renamed (mercs) to (mercsr1) and (mercsua) to (mercs).
  * Added Street Fighter II: The World Warrior (World 910228).
  * Added missing notes about ROMs sockets to megaman.
  * Confirmed B-Board # for forgottnua, willowje, cawingu, fixed their labels where wrong and added pcb infos to video\cps1.c.
  * Removed incorrect ROMs relationship between parent/clones in ffightj, ffightj1, ffightj2 and cawingj.
  * Minor cleanups and fixes.
- Replaced smgolfb with correct dump [D. Beneke, M. David, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union].
- MESS fixes [Miodrag Milanovic]:
  * Fixed issue with image empty slot.
  * Default for writeconfig is now 0 for MESS since it is not needed anymore.
  * Fixed handling of mounted devices on hard reset.
  * Unified some emuopts code, and removed ifdefs.
- Corrected several ROMs name in the Sega System32 driver. Most notably the correct revision for Spider-man & Golden Axe II US sets [The Dumping Union].
- Hooked up MSM5205 sample playback routines to Rougien, disabled by default because sample start write handler is still a mystery [Angelo Salese].
- Updated Naomi/Naomi2 M2/M3 encryption [Andreas Naive].
- Fix F4 shortcut so it explicitly labels the address as a number by preceding it with "0x". This allows F4 to work properly, for example, on the 68000 stepping to address a6, which also happens to be a register name [Aaron Giles].
- More updates to Naomi/Naomi2 M2/M3 decryption [Andreas Naive].
- Added proper sample playback in Rougien [Andrew Welburn, Angelo Salese].
- Split the screen device into a separate module. Converted global video routines into a video_manager. Moved video manager initialization earlier in startup [Aaron Giles].
- Allowed the use of either decimal or hexadecimal values for <dataarea> size, <rom> size, and <rom> offset in software lists [Curt Coder].
- Fixed array bounds problems found by GCC 4.5.x [qmc2, R. Belmont].
- Fixed BSD compile [ElBarto].
- m680x0: Many FPU and PMMU fixes and enhancements [Hans Ostermeyer].
- Various device fixes/enhancements [Hans Ostermeyer]:
  * mc146818: Add UTC mode, various enhancements and fixes.
  * 68681: Fixes for loopback mode.
  * 6840ptm: Status register update fixes.
  * pic8259: IRQ semantics fixes.
  * 8237dma: Added memory-to-memory transfers.
- CPS-3 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Added JoJo's Venture USA bios ROM CD version.
  * Reordered some CPS sets per release date in mamedriv.c.
  * Minor cleanups and fixes.
- Updated the Space Stranger overlay layout by adding the overlay for the Upright version, which looks different to the Cocktail [MASH].
- Added support for Karateco's "Super Double" to the goldnpkr driver [Gerrit Volkenborn].
- Improved PGM Video RAM mirroring [David Haywood].
