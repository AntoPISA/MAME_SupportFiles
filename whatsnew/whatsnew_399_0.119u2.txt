model2c_crx0119u1red [R. Belmont]


Source changes:
---------------
Changed gfx_decode structures so that they are defined abstractly
by macros rather than directly specifying the structures. Added
new macros GFXDECODE_START/GFXDECODE_ENTRY/GFXDECODE_END to
describe the gfx_decode information. Converted all drivers over to
using the new macros. [Atari Ace]

Fixed NMI handling in h6280 CPU core. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed vaportra to use an ASSERT/CLEAR mechanism instead of PULSE_LINE
for interrupt signally. [Wilbert Pol]

Cleaned up input ports in sg1000a.c. Added DIP switch for the coins 
in dokidoki and service switch. Added DIP switch for flip screen in
psychic5. [sonikos]

Cleans up the input port for macrossp.c driver and adds dip 
locations [Brian Troha].

Adds dip locations and changes the Japanese inputs into 
PORT_INCLUDE and PORT_MODIFY [Brian Troha].

Added macros to clean up definitions of the discrete sound 
interfaces. At the same time, made them all const. [Atari Ace]

Some miscellaneous changes to the megatech driver [David Haywood].

More srmp6 improvements. [686]

Two small Model 2 fixes: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - fixed triangle parser; all objects should be structurally 
    correct now
 - fixed normal transform to not use the translation vectors

Cleaned up code to make code and data static where possible and
remove some dead code. [Atari Ace]

SCSP improvements: [R. Belmont, ElSemi]
 - fixed issue with changing the pitch of an active voice set to 
    backwards or bidirectional loop
 - removed fake reverb
 - fixed internal DSP to operate properly 
 - rewrote timers and interrupt handling
 - fixed operation when 2 SCSPs are present

Fixed sound in almost all SCSP-equipped Model 2 games [R. Belmont].

Added sound hardware and fixed sound ROM loading in Model 3 games.
[R. Belmont]

Created an options_output_diff_ini_file() API, which is similar to 
options_output_ini_file(), but only outputs the options which are 
different than a base core_options. Changed INI outputting (and 
hence the -cc option) to omit headers that do not contain any 
options [Nathan Woods].

Hooked up sound in discoboy. [Tomasz Slanina]

Renamed old gfx_decode structure to gfx_decode_entry in order to
catch remaining/new drivers that aren't using the new macros.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed profiler so that it is independently selected versus the
debug build. Built with MAME_PROFILER=1 to enable the profiler on
a non-debug build. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed MIPS3 disassembly of j/jal instructions. [Aaron Giles]

Switched MIPS3 64-bit DRC over to new system that is more aggressive
about register allocation and mapping. Sadly, there is little to no
obvious performance benefit, but the resulting code is better
organized. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed nasty x86emit bug involving 16-bit opcodes on 64-bit systems.
[Aaron Giles]

Created new generic x86/x64 logging system x86log, and updated both
MIPS3 DRC cores to use it. [Aaron Giles]

Created new generic DRC frontend management. Future work involves
retooling the MIPS3 frontend around this new architecture.
