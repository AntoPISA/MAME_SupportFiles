Source changes:
---------------
- Improved offsets of the "normal spites" in the SSV games twineag2, ultrax, and dynagear [robiza].
- Added missing video change to the lethalen driver [David Haywood].
- Some nice improvements to the debugger [Andrew Gardner]:
  * Added ability to tab between views in the disassembly windows.
  * Added a 'cursor' to the dasm view and hooked up navigation keys.
  * Added F4 'run to here' key when the disasm view has focus.
  * Added F9 'toggle breakpoint' key when the disasm view has focus.
  * Enhanced memory view keyboard navigation.
- Added workaround for crash in the sound code under some edge cases [David Haywood].
- Fixed background ROM loading in the new wbmlbg set [David Haywood].
- Overhauled and corrected the DIP switches in the trivia and quiz games in the findout driver [wolf676].
- Added PORT_DIPLOCATION to the airbustr driver [Roberto Fresca].
- TIA-MC1 driver improvements [Eugene Sandulenko]:
  * Fixed documentation.
  * Hooked game counter and coin lockout.
  * Added save state support.
- Fixed 6840 counter behavior in continuous mode [El Condor].
- Identified some unknown DIP switches in Robby Roto [wolf676].
- Big update to the arkanoid driver which improves emulation of some bootlegs [Steph]:
  * Interverted 'arkblock' and 'arkbloc2' sets for better comparaison.
  * Renamed sets: (arkbl2) to (arkmcubl) and (arkbl3) to (arkgcbl).
  * Changed some games descriptions.
  * Removed flags from the following sets: (arkbloc2) (old 'arkblock'), (arkgcbl) (old 'arkbl3') and (paddle2).
- Fixed a multithreading race condition at startup [Nathan Woods].
- Added some minimal validation on the sample rate configuration parameters [Firewave].
- Fixed a few dips and added diplocation setting for Wonder Stick in the nmg5.c driver [Brian Troha].
- Big update to the MPU4 driver [El Condor]:
  * Added support for reverse clocking in the VFD code. 
  * Changed the 6840 to not run the counter clock if no frequency is specified.
  * Reworked the MPU4 drastically to be more in sync with AGEMAME.
  * MPU4 video should now be working a little better.
  * Deprecated 6850acia.c, replacing it with a specialized driver.
- Updated core.mak to ensure the make clean will remove file2str.exe [Nathan Woods].
- Added new ROM loading option, ROM_IGNORE() which works just like ROM_CONTINUE() except that you don't need to load the data anywhere. It can be used when larger ROMs are present and only a portion of the data is used. See solomon.c for an example [Aaron Giles].
- Removed support for the old debugger [Aaron Giles].
- Added driver_data member to the Machine structure, where drivers can hang data instead of using global variables. Added MDRV_DRIVER_DATA macro so the core can allocate this structure at startup. Added AM_BASE_MEMBER and AM_SIZE_MEMBER which are similar to AM_BASE and AM_SIZE but let you specify a member of a struct hanging off of driver_data. Updated the Turbo driver to use these new features as an experiment [Aaron Giles].
- More Turbo driver cleanup [Aaron Giles]:
  * Doubled the horizontal resolution to better draw analog sprites.
  * Improved Buck Rogers and Subroc video.
