Source changes:
---------------
- Actually included the RF5C400 changes mentioned for 0.112u4 [hoot development team].
- Added diplocations to the driver segas16a, segas16b, segas18, megaplay, news, ninjadks2 and nemesis drivers. In segas16b, added in SDI allow_continue. In megaplay (Mazin Wars) updated the name of dip with the real name from game setting [Ruben].
- Added preliminary sound to Destroyer and Altair. White noise is missing, and Draco is still silent [Curt Coder].
- Added save state support to Combatribes and Jail Break [Kevin Eshbach].
- Added tools to generate regression tests and mamedev.org-compatible reports. The report generator is cross-platform, but the test running code is Windows-only at the moment [Aaron Giles].
- Changed file2str to be built into the obj directory [Aaron Giles].
- Changed the Tournament Street Fighter games to not have a network adapter present by default [David Haywood].
- Defined several new exit codes for "unknown game" and "invalid config" and changed the Windows OSD layer to output them [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed a number of BIOS-only drivers to not crash when run [R. Belmont, Aaron Giles].
- Fixed all analog controls for the newly enabled validity checks including the following [Derrick Renaud]:
  * demndrgn: Changed to proper IPT_AD_STICK controls.
  * konamigt, hcrash, rf2: Set to proper PADDLE control and fixed mask.
  * midvunit.c: Changed games so the brake pedal shows on player1.
  * overdriv: Changed to proper PADDLE control.
  * simpbowl: Fixed port mask, now trackball works proper without glitching.
  * sspeedr: Changed to IPT_POSITIONAL with PORT_REMAP_TABLE controls for gas and steering fixing both.
  * ssrj: Fixed gas pedal.
  * namcos2: Fixed inputs on all games (may need to delete nv files).
- Fixed bug where the window thread would stop processing events when MAME was paused [BUT].
- Fixed incorrect Eolith speedup patch from u3 [David Haywood].
- Fixed regression in Nintendo games that did not specify a clock for the NES APU [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed regressions in 3 of the discrete games from 0.112u4 [Derrick Renaud].
- Fixed the model2.c ROM definitions for some games that weren't even loading and made the infamous unknown z-sort mode not a fatal error [R. Belmont].
- Minor cleanup of Berzerk driver [Lord Nightmare].
- Removed cpu_gethorzbeampos() and replaced it with calls to video_screen_get_hpos(). Also changed TMS34010 configuration to take a screen number, and changed atarigen_get_hblank() to take a screen number as well [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Removed obsolete joystick calibration junk from the osdepend layer. If anyone needs this functionality, I will look into providing a way for the OSD code to add menus in the UI [Aaron Giles].
- Removed unnecessary idle skipping code from the m92 and deco32 drivers. This allows removal of a couple of now-unused functions from cpuexec [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Rewrote the BSMT2000 to be more accurate. Various modes are now software selected at startup based on the register value at reset time. Changed all existing drivers so they properly hooked up the reset line on the chip in order to make this control work. Also added correct BSMT2000 ADPCM output [Aaron Giles].
- Split the sprint4 and ultratnk drivers again. Brought the Sprint 4 driver up to date [Stefan Jokisch].
