Source changes:
---------------
-Added data-driven shader system for BGFX renderer [Ryan Holtz]
 * Allows an arbitrary number of passes, with arbitrary connections
   between passes.
 * Ships by default with three effects: default, unfiltered, and hlsl
   * default: Simple bilinear stretch
   * unfiltered: Simple nearest-neighbor stretch
   * hlsl: A close reimplementation of the Direct3D HLSL shaders. Does not currently support bloom or vectors.
 * Select the "shader chain" you wish to use with -bgfx_screen_chains
 * Adjust the settings to your liking with slider controls, saving and
    loading settings and presets will be added in a future version.
 * See bgfx/chains/hlsl.json ans bgfx/hlsl/blit.json for JSON format
    rules.
 * For additional information, see the official MAME documentation.
-Improved Scanline Simulation [ImJezze]
 * Changed the amount of scanline darkness, a setting of 1.0 now
    becomes fully black (to get the same result as before, halve your
    current setting)
 * Scanline height now depends on the brightness of the underlying
    color
 * The amount of the scanline brightness and overdrive now depends on
    the scanline darkness
 * Renamed 'Scanline Screen Height' to 'Scanline Screen Scale' and
    'Scanline Indiv. Height' to 'Scanline Height'
 - Fixed Bloom Level Alignment
   * Fixed target dimensions of bloom levels, which results in much
      better alignment, especially for games with very low resolutions.
      Therefore, current bloom settings might appear less intense than
      before.
 - Quality and Performance improvements
   * HLSL now uses non-power-of-two-sized target surfaces (breaks
      compatibility with graphics cards based on R300/R400/NV30 and older)
   * HLSL target surfaces now have the size of the screen canvas
   * Removed HLSL pre-scale factor
   * HLSL now uses a sharp bilinear interpolation to pre-scale textures
      to screen canvas size, based on [Themaister]'s implementation
   * Improved overall performance. Based on the previously required
      pre-scale factors, speedups range 5-50% depending on graphics
      hardware, more if a higher prescale factor was used.
   * Improved shadow mask quality (pixel-perfect) in screen-mode
   * Fixed half source texel offset of bloom level alignment
   * Removed ./hlsl/artwork_support folder
   * All shaders after pre-scale are now based on screen coordinates
      (workaground until both raster and vector passes can work on texture
      coordinates)
   * Disabled distortion shader for more than one screen and for
      artworks in full mode, does not affect artworks in cropped mode
      (workaground until both raster and vector passes can work on texture
      coordinates)

-at: Created at motherboard device and split PCI and PS/2 machines into
 own files [Carl]

-UI [Maurizio Petrarota]
 * Enabled user interface navigation through UI_CONFIGURE button (tab
    key by default).
 * Added support for "covers" images collection.
 * Added support for "gameinit.dat".
 * Improved ROM-less checking at startup.
 * Improved vertical orientation rendering.
 * Fixed missing mouseover highlight.
 * Fixed search in software lists.
 * Fixed DATs reload after path changes.
 * Fixed software load failure from BIOS submenu.
 
-Bloom refactoring [ImJezze]
 * Calculation of bloom dimensions is now done only once, when render
    target is created.
 * Reduced blur width for non-vector screens.
 * Implemented shadow UV option for source tile mode.

-apple2gs.cpp: Dumped the 341-0749 ROM and confirmed the 341-0728 Apple
 IIGS ROMs [Brian Troha].

-Type-safe C++ printf analog and vector-backed iostreams [Vas Crabb]
 * Supports most C99, glibc, SUS and MSVCRT format specifications
 * Allows formatting any object with stream output operator with %s
 * Replaces strformat, strprintf and strcatprintf
 * Move to type-safe templates for logerror and popmessage
 * Remove now-unnecessary I64FMT from calls to logerror/popmessage
 * Eliminate core_i64_format functions for the most part

-Modernised much of the file handling code [Vas Crabb]
 * Made core_file, osd_file, and avi_file and polymorphic classes
 * Moved osd_file implementations to shareable OSD module code
 * Made zip/7z implementations of archive_file with common API
 * Prefer destructors over explicit close functions
 * Made APIs supply smart pointers
 * Pass std::string though lots of APIs rather than C string pointers
 * Added methods for flushing user-space file buffers
 * Made archive_file create/destroy thread-safe
 * Fixed buffer overrun when walking zip ECD
 * Fixed some resource leaks in file handling code
 * Fixed edge cases where incorrect error code was returned on Windows
 * Added Solaris PTY implementation
 * Support ~/$FOO/${BAR} expansion with SDL OSD
 * Made emu_file handle zip and 7z archives identically
 * Search archives with CRC+path, CRC+partial path, CRC, path, partial
    path when loading ROMs/artwork/cheats/etc.
 * Added support for 7z archives via zippath API
 * Support 7z archives for fullpath loading and media file manager
 * Made romcmp tool support 7z archives

-Improved OSD font API [Vas Crabb]
 * Release font handles on destruction
 * Moved font enumeration into OSD, implement for SDL, Windows, OSX
 * Fixed drawing characters outside Unicode BMP with sdl_ttf
 * Support TTC fonts with sdl_ttf
 * Separated font display names from configuration names
 * Made OSX font configuration name the PostScript face name
 * Made sdl_ttf configuration name Family|Style
 * Supply ui_small font as a BDF file with Adobe glyph names

 header I/O code (thanks Tafoid for reporting), fix divide-by-zero in
 pathological case of zero-frame recording [Vas Crabb]

-Fixed file naming issue when creating new image from internal file
 manager with media loaded (thanks BIOS-D for reporting) [Vas Crabb]

 * Split primary.fx into 3 techniques for vector buffer, screen
    and UI pass
 * Moved register_texture() for shaders outside of texture_info
    creation
 * Added render_primitive parameter to register_texture(); currently
    unused
 * Removed other unused register_texture() definition

    Advance (color LCD)

-ibm5170.xml: Added SICOS mouse driver and SICOS Paint [Curt Coder].

-Super Poker: Added the missing PPI 8255s and routed the involved
 inputs/outputs through them. 3super8 has PPI initialization
 routines, but seems to be a leftover since it lacks them. Also
 cleaned up the driver and added technical notes [Roberto Fresca].

-Added layout for Frankie Dettori's 7th Heaven [John Parker]

-NoteTaker: Hooked up more of the IOCPU I/O registers. Separated reset
 functions for IOCPU and EmulatorCPU [Lord Nightmare].

 beeps on boot. Fixed several wrong polarity status bits. Documented
 where the framebuffer lives. Better documented the boot process.
 Hooked up the VSync Interrupt [Lord Nightmare].

-Updated Frankie Dettori layout to MAME 'dark' style [John Parker]

-svi318: Rewrote driver. Supported are the SVI-318 and SVI-328
 systems, and a slot system which adds support for the following
 expander slot options:
 * SV-601 Super Expander
 * SV-602 Single Slot Expander
 * SV-603 Coleco Game Adapter (no controller support yet)
 The slot expander cards enable support for the standard

 still [Lord Nightmare].

-r9751 improvements [Brandon Munger]
 * Fixed more DMA issues and added more logging
 * Moved PDC floppy command trigger to correct register

-Added common debugger commands to global menu bar in OSX [Vas Crabb] 
 Also fixed occasional crash in Copy Visible.  Note that copy
 visible, paste, toggle breakpoint, and view options still require you
 to use context menus in windows.  Debug/Run menus only work when a
 debugger window has focus, so Break is less useful than it could be.

-floppy: Fixed subtle interaction between wd_fdc initial restore and floppy reset [O. Galibert] 

-IGS Super Poker: Decrypted all the US/UA sets. They are still not
 working due to hardware differences with the former ones laying in the
 driver. I/O are driven through IGS custom IC's instead of 2x PPI8255
 devices [Roberto Fresca].

-NoteTaker: Attached FDC and floppy drive [Lord Nightmare].

-NoteTaker: Began to hooking up DiskReg register [Lord Nightmare].

 * Use c++ "for each" in a number of places
 * Fixed two "time bombs" 

-Implemented integer scaling in core renderer [Calamity]
 * Moved -unevenstretch option to core renderer.
   -unevenstretch:   fractional stretching (default)
   -nounevenstretch: integer scaling
 * Added new options to core renderer:
   -unevenstretchx:  fractional stretching on horizontal axis, integer
                     scaling on vertical axis
   -intscalex:       horizontal integer scale factor, default is 0 (auto)
   -intscaley:       vertical integer scale factor, default is 0 (auto)

-Symbolics 3600: Added more documentation of the FEP PCB from PCB pictures.
. [Lord Nightmare].

 maps from the patent, but these do not seem to match the 3670 exactly,
 more investigation is required [Lord Nightmare].

-Added additional sanity checking to the tms9927/crt5027 core.
. [Lord Nightmare].
