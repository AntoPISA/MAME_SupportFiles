---------------------------------------
NOTE: If you are experiencing sound stuttering due to not being able to run your display at >60Hz, please give the -speed option a try. You should be able to run MAME at a small emulation speed decrease in order to get the game under your monitor's refresh rate.

Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed recently introduced regression in nemesis driver [Atari Ace].
- Improved fixes to the chdman CD creating code [smf].
- Updated amspdwy.c driver to fix the DIP switches for (amspdwy) which are slightly different than the ones for (amspdwya) which were correct [stephh].
- Fixed HP Saturn CPU core disassembler [Wilbert Pol].
- Fixed clock speed and colors in "Trivia Genius" [Lord Nightmare].
- Cleaned up Taito drivers to use common defines for common input ports across drivers [stephh].
- Removed redundant hard-coded definitions for "Pole Position" pedals [Alex Jackson].
- Improved DIP switches for (bombjack) [stephh].
- Changed default layouts in BFM games to hide VFD by default since it is not visible [James Wallace].
- Further improvements to the TMS5220 emulation and more unification with the TMS5110 core [Lord Nightmare].
- Changed INI parsing to look for source file INIs in <inipath>/source first. This is to disambiguate INIs where the game name matches the source filename. If the INI file is not found in <inipath>/source, then it is looked for in the <inipath> as before [Aaron Giles].
- Merged "Raiden" memory maps. Cleaned up the COP emulation code in "Raiden 2" [Aaron Giles].
- Added new experimental control for overall emulation speed. This lets you specify how fast/slow the gameplay should happen relative to the original. -speed 1.0 means run at normal speed. -speed 2.0 means run at 2x speed. -speed 0.5 means run at half speed. Note that the sound pitch is shifted as a result. If you are running early Namco games that normally run at 60.60Hz, you can run them at -speed 0.99 and it should run at under 60Hz, which should prevent sound stuttering if your monitor is not capable of greater than 60Hz refresh rates. If this turns out to be useful, future versions may support a -speed refresh parameter that automatically tweaks the speed to keep you under your monitor's refresh rate [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed disassembly of V30 bit instructions [Aaron Giles].
