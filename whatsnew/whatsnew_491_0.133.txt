- Added FP registers to PPC debugger interface. Fixed bugs in the x64 back-end that prevented proper 3D rendering for Model 3 games [Aaron Giles].
- ARM7 improvements [R. Belmont]:
  * Added ARMv5+ CLZ instruction;
  * Added ARMv5TE instructions: QADD, QDADD, QSUB, QDSUB, SMLAxy, SMLALxy, SMULxy, SMULWy, and SMLAWy;
