Source changes:
---------------
- Add logic to ensure that shared pointers are checked to be of the right width. The primary upshot is that if you declare AM_SHARE("paletteram") in an 8-bit memory map, then only m_generic_paletteram_8 will be populated, and m_generic_paletteram_16 will be NULL. But it applies to all required_/optional_shared_ptrs declared, so make sure they are of the right type [Aaron Giles].
- Added CD compressor template which separates subcode data from sector data, removes redundant ECC data prior to compression, and uses separate compressors for each part. Defined LZMA and ZLib CD compressors based on this and made them the default for CDs [Aaron Giles].
- Added code to cdrom.c to compute and verify ECC codes for mode 1/2 sector [David Haywood].
- Allow compilation with compatible system-installed versions of libjpeg and libflac [wallyweek, R. Belmont].
- BFM Scorpion 4 Hardware [David Haywood]:
  * Added various devices to the SC4 emulation, added a default layout showing the VFD, to which most of the earlier games will now write 'Initializing'. Timers and other devices still need to be implemented properly before they actually initialize.
  * General update which fleshes out some of the 68307 code (not 100% correct hookups, just improved logging and enough to get us somewhere).
  * Put the actual SC4 hardware emulation in drivers/bfm_sc4h.c so that it doesn't get lost in the swamp of sets (scrolling through a file is quite hard when it's almost entirely set definitions).
- Change DirectInput joystick acquisition method to be non exclusive [bdam].
- Changed required_/optional_shared_ptr to support set_target with base and size for manually configuring a shared pointer, and a new allocate method for dynamically allocating (and registering the memory for save states) [Aaron Giles].
- Converted gamtor.c to use VGA device (doesn't work though due of a weird banking problem) [Angelo Salese].
- Converted memory_private to memory_manager and moved global memory operations into methods on it. Converted the less-popular cases over in drivers that used them, leaving the bank management APIs global for now [Aaron Giles].
- dc: Fix the maple hookup and controllers and add the missing maple irq [Olivier Galibert].
- Decrypted sprites in lhzb. Decrypted tiles and palette in lhzb2 and slqz2. Added inputs and memory maps in these games, pending protection simulation [Luca Elia].
- Decrypted the rest of the gambling sets in igs_m027.c. No further advancements in visible emulation to report, though [iq132].
- Fixed ymf271.c core timer allowing for greater accuracy [Sonikos]
- galaxia.c: Improved colors and hooked up cvs stars circuit [hap].
- galdrvr.c: Added preliminary protection emulation to Monster Zero [hap].
- Hooked up TMS9928 and PIA devices to Baby Pac-Man video CPU, gives some GFX if you press the service switch [Angelo Salese].
- Implemented flip screen support to Mirax [Angelo Salese].
- Improved irqs in Little Robin, and added preliminary sound to it [Angelo Salese].
- m68k: add preliminary on-board peripherals to 68307 and 68340 [David Haywood].
- Major driver modernization changes [Miodrag Milanović]:
  * Added 4th parameter to all address maps;
  * Added missing state classes;
  * Removed ADDRESS_MAP_MODERN define.
- mirax, miraxa (mirax.c) Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs (after verification of the Z80 code) [stephh].
- Misc sc4/68307 updates + prelim peripheral hookups, allows most sc4 sets to run their sound ROM checks [David Haywood].
- model2.c: Added the I/O Controller ROM (Z80 based) for 'Rail Chase 2' [Brian Troha, The Dumping Union].
- Move driver list/enumerator to new file drivenum.c/.h. Move game_driver definition and constants to new header gamedrv.h. [Aaron Giles].
- Moved all drivers to using the paletteram helpers defined in the driver_device base class. The palette base is now specified via an AM_SHARE of "paletteram" or "paletteram2". The driver_device base class now finds these pointers and places them in m_generic_paletteram_8/_16/_32 and m_generic_paletteram2_8/_16/_32 [Aaron Giles].
- namcos10: Fix banking for Mr. Driller 2, first stab at the encryption [Olivier Galibert].
- namcos21.c: Added Namco game prefix to the Winning Run 91 set. Added minor documentation about the System21B two board stack [Brian Troha].
- nmk16.c: Fixes some issues and cleaned up the video sources a bit [trap15].
- pgm.c: Continued refactoring of the protections, including improved notes. Moved some code into the states and split states by protection type [David Haywood]
- rastan.c: Add DIP switch locations to the Rastan sets [Brian Troha].
- rastan.c: Cleaned up Parent/Child order. Corrected ROM names and added additional information / notes [Brian Troha].
- Redumped sound roms in funcube2 and funcube3 [Guru, Yasuhiro Ogawa].
- Redumped sprites ROM of lhzb2 [Guru].
- Removed machine.generic.paletteram*, and machine.generic entirely. Removed AM_BASE_GENERIC/AM_SIZE_GENERIC as they don't apply anymore [Aaron Giles].
- SDL: Fix formatting of chdman man page [wallyweek].
- Set the correct cpu in mpu5.c driver and split a few alternate revisions into clone sets [David Haywood].
- Solved the remaining issues with Raiden 2's sprite decryption [Andreas Naive].
- toaplan2.c: Correct the video (character layer) offset for 1945 Part-2 (Chinese hack of Battle Garegga) [David Haywood].
- wldarrow.c: Added service inputs, allowing battery RAM to be initialized in test mode, making the games close to playable [hap].
