--------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE TO OSD DEVELOPERS: The file I/O interface has changed significantly. It is now much simpler. Please read osdepend.h for full details on how the new OSD-defined functions work. In addition, you must now use the options.c to specify your search paths. If you are parsing standard command line options and INI files, this work is relatively straightforward. Otherwise, you can manually call options_set_string() for each of the search paths to configure them from whatever options store you are using.

Source changes:
---------------
- More findout.c/getrivia.c improvements [wolf676]:
  * Added ticket dispenser to Trivia/Sexual Trivia;
  * Found last unknown DIP switch in Selection/Poker;
  * Added missing "Payout" button; payout hardware unknown;
  * Added missing "Play / Raise" button and its lamp 9;
  * Added "Button 12 ?" to selection, function unknown;
  * Re-added PORT_IMPULSE(2) to poker games buttons because they do not like it if two or more buttons are held; trivia games still respond better without this;
  * Changed coin_lockout_global to coin_lockout_w(0) and coin_lockout_w(1) for 2 coin slots in selection;
  * Added missing lamps 11 (coin slot 2), 12 and 13 (unknown) to selection.
- Fixed crash in the MPU4 driver [El Condor].
- Hooked up ARM ROM for kovsh, though it doesn't work yet [ElSemi].
- Some fixes for the 8080bw driver [Robbbert]:
  * The correct samples are being used for lrescue, lrescuem, grescue, desterth;
  * DIP switch corrections for superinv, invadrmr, sinvemag, spceking, spacewr3;
  * Remove extraneous beeping noise from indianbt.
- Converted all the toaplan2.c games to mono since the PCBs are JAMMA without external stereo connectors [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Added bounds checking to the qsound driver [David Haywood].
- Redesigned the OSD file I/O interfaces to be simpler and more straightforward. Also simplified the core's file I/O routines and included some functionality that was previously left to the OSD layer [Aaron Giles].
- Rewrote unzip.c to return richer errors and generally behave better [Aaron Giles].
- Rewrote audit.c to simplify the code and not rely on extraneous functions that were in the old file I/O system [Aaron Giles].
- Simplified the 68000 core generation logic to just produce one file. Hopefully this will cure some of the build issues with the core [Aaron Giles].
