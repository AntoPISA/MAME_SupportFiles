------------------------------------------
Note: the CPU cores are still in a state of flux. Most of the problems in 0.35b1 have been fixed, however some still remain (e.g. Gauntlet doesn't accept coins and Exterminator crashes).

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Accurate colors in Mariner [Gerald Coy].
- Almost accurate colors in Galivan [Nicola Salmoria].
- Attempt at emulating some raster effects in the NeoGeo games. The IRQ2 handling is still 99% unknown, however you can see the field in Super Sidekicks 3 and 4. This is largely unaccurate, and VERY slow. Hit F1 to toggle the emulation on or off (by default it's on) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed (?) the title in Galaxian Part X [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed gaps in the start/finish line in Neo Drift Out [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed sprite colors in Euro League [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed sprite flipping in Jack the Giant Killer end sequence [Brad Oliver].
- Fixed sprites disappearing abruptly in TMNT end of game credits [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed the green and white flags in Championship Sprint / Super Sprint, and maybe other Atari System 2 sprites as well [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed the sprite/playfield and playfield/playfield priorities in Bad Dudes / Dragon Ninja and Sly Spy [Bryan McPhail].
- Fixed the title screen in P.O.W [Bryan McPhail].
- Improved row scrolling in Street Fighter 2, plus several other fixes to the CPS1 games [Paul Leaman].


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------
- Added support for the 7751 sound chip in Monster Bash. Two samples are still needed (discrete circuits) [Mike Balfour].
- Emulated speech in Sinistar. Samples are no longer used [Alex Pasadyn].
- Fixed the YM2203 in Ghost Busters [Bryan McPhail].
- Good progress in sound emulation of the Exidy games (Venture, Pepper 2, etc.) [Dan Boris].
- Sound fade timer ports in the CPS1 games (see Willow's Test mode for an example) [Paul Leaman].
- Sound in The Main Event [Nicola Salmoria].
- Speech in TMNT. Sound should now be 100% complete [Howie Cohen].
- uPD7759 support in Golden Axe, Shinobi, Passshtb, Alien Syndrome, Altered Beast [Howie Cohen].


These drivers have HIGH SCORE support:
--------------------------------------
- Side Pocket, Rolling Thunder [Dave W.].


Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- Emulated the protection in Knights of the Round and Carrier Air Wing [Paul Leaman].
- Emulated the protection in Seicross, Radical Radial, Frisky Tom. However Frisky Tom is still not playable (hangs when you fall) [Nicola Salmoria].
- The hang in Tapper should REALLY be fixed this time [Juergen Buchmueller].


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------
- [DOS] The key to change frameskip is now F9 instead of F8 [Nicola Salmoria].


Source changes:
---------------
- CVSD emulation, used for speech in Sinistar and in the 34010 games (Smash TV etc.) [Larry Bank, Alex Pasadyn].
- Fixed some bugs in the I8039 emulation [Brian Stern].
- NEC uPD7759 emulation. This is used by TMNT, System 16, and others [Juergen Buchmueller, Mike Balfour, Howie Cohen].
- New 68000 C core. For testing purposes, this is also being used in the DOS version instead of the asm core [Karl Stenerud]:
  - Differences:
  * Faster. This code is, barring RAM fetch time, almost twice as fast as the existing C core in MAME.  I've done extensive speed profiling on both engines.  The only problem now is the slow memory access in MAME due to bankswitching et al;
  * Emulation more correct. I found many bugs in the MAME engine (and many, many more in mine for that matter) when I pitted them head-to-head. I have run random instructions from each opcode class at least 10 million times, comparing the resultant CPU states, and have left it running random instructions for 1 billion iterations. In every case, I have adhered to the specs defined in M68000PM/AD REV. 1;
  * Disassembler is correct. The current M68000 disassembler in mame has a tendency to disassemble instructions that have an invalid EA mode;
  * Cycle counting is 99.9% correct.  The only instructions which don't have correct cycle counts are divs, divu, muls, mulu, and they're not worth counting correctly. (I'm not about to waste emulation time counting 0-1 and 1-0 sequences);
  * > 32 bit friendly.  I've taken care to ensure maximum portability without sacrificing speed. The result is conditional compiling dependant on your architecture.  I've also implemented and tested a compatible solution for architectures that lack 8, 16, or 32 bit signed storage types;
  * The code is carefully laid out to be readable (I beg to differ - NS).
- Z8000 emulator [Juergen Buchmueller].
