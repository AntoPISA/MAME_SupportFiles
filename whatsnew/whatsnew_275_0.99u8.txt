Source changes:
---------------
- Added save/restore of tilemap parameters [Aaron Giles].
- Improvements to the ST-V driver [Mariusz Wojcieszek]:
  * dma: Added another checking for dma parameters.
  * stv: Changed v-blank timing.
  * vdp1: Implemented two framebuffers and flipping.
  * vdp1: Added manual changing and erasing of framebuffers.
  * vdp1: Added manual trigger for drawing.
  * vdp1: Mapped framebuffer into memory (for 16bpp only).
  * vdp1: Added shadow and half luminance for RGB sprites.
  * vdp2: Fixed bitmaps scrolling (fixes bad gfx in batmanfr and bakubaku intro).
  * vdp2: Added preliminary window effect for tilemaps and sprite layer (for batmanfr).
  * vdp2: Added scaling for 8bpp and 15bpp bitmaps (fixes vmahjong and myfairld backgrounds).
- Fixed sprite-sprite priorities in toaplan1 games [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed background color in 'Jolly Jogger' [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Made input port conditionals work more generically. This necessitated a bit of a minor reorg in the input port code. Please verify that controls work as before. This change has also required a modification to how analog ports are recorded, so existing INPs may not work [Aaron Giles].
- Minor tweak to fix 'Time Crisis' crash [Phil Stroffolino].
- Fixed spurious vectors in 'Top Gunner' [Mathis Rosenhauer].
- Added new functions memory_configure_bank() and memory_set_bank() which abstract bankswitching better. This allows current memory banking states to automatically be saved for drivers that use this feature. m62.c games have been updated to use this new feature as an example [Aaron Giles].
