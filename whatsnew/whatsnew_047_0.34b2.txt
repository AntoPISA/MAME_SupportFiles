New clones supported:
--------------------
xxx


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- The background in 'Golden Star' changes color correctly [Nicola Salmoria].
- Accurate colors in 'Astro Fighter' (PROMs required) [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Accurate colors in 'Lost Tomb' (PROMs required) [Michael Appolo].
- Fixed tile flipping bug in 'Solomon's Key' [Nicola Salmoria].


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------
- The music in 'Bubble Bobble' seems to stay in sync now [Tatsuyuki Satoh].


Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- 'Dynasty Wars' works (actually it was already working, it's just that the dip switches had Freeze on by default).
- 'Front Line' and 'Tin Star' have the aiming dial (using a dual joystick setup). Also, you can now kill and be killed in 'Front Line'. However, collision detection is not accurately emulated [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed ending in 'Robocop' [JC Alexander].
- *FINALLY* fixed Commando sometimes not starting. It was a bug in the decode routine, which has been completely rewritten [Nicola Salmoria].


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------
- Vector translucency can be turned off with -notranslucency [Valerio Verrando].


Source changes:
----------------
- TMS34010 emulator [Alex Pasadyn, Zsolt Vasvari].
- Replaced the 6502 emulator with a new one which also supports 65C02 and 6510. Marat Fayzullin's core is no longer used [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Fixed a bug in the 68000 BCD emulation which caused the 'F1 Dream' timer to malfunction [Nicola Salmoria].
- New function osd_on_screen_display() to show text over the game screen [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed bug in the Z80 block I/O instructions (INI, IND, INIR, INDR, OUTI, OUTD, OTIR, and OTDR) [Frank Palazzolo].
- Updated the FM emulation and the way the 8910 updates its buffers. FM also has support for YM2608 and YM2612, though they are not compiled in [Tatsuyuki Satoh].
- [DOS] Rearranged the makefile using archives to work around E2BIG error on some machines [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Support for CRC-32 checksums instead of MAME's custom ones. The actual CRCs will be added later to the drivers [John Butler].
