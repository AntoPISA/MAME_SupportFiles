  * Reduced number of used render targets from 7 to 4 (2 native and 2 pre-scaled).
  * Made render pass functions (nearly) independent from each other.
  * Unified render pipeline for raster and vector graphics, which means that all effects are now also available for vector graphics (except scan-lines).

  * Fixed bloom stair-step artifacts when screen is curved.
  * Added smooth border effect and option, its amount is limited by the amount of rounded corners.
  * Added bloom overdrive effect and options, this effect allows to overdrive pure colors like red, green and blue to become more brighter.

  * Many other small changes and refactoring.

  * Fixed vector flicker.
  * Replace beam width by beam width min. and beam width max. width, this makes it possible to create a linear dynamic beam width by the amount of intensity of the beam.
  * Added beam intensity weight, this adds an exponential factor to the dynamic beam width (values greater than 0 will push larger intensities more than smaller intensities).
  * Fixed ratio of "vector points" (zero-length lines).
- psxcd: Declaring ROM images for the CDROM controller MCU [Felipe Sanches].
- Apollo changes [Hans Ostermeyer]:
  * Fixed the Apollo floppy disk emulation.
