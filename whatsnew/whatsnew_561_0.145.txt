Happy 15th Anniversary! Over its 15 years of existence since MAME 0.01 was released for MS-DOS with an initial library of 5 sets, MAME has grown exponentially to the point that no one thought we would be, boasting 18,650 different sets and operable on more OS platforms than thought possible. While video-based arcade games were the original targets for MAME, the scope of the project has grown to include documentation of virtually all coin-operated amusement devices including gambling (video/slots), coin droppers, pinball machines and more. Through the efforts of the literally thousands of developers, players and others who have provided assistance and feedback over the project's history, we would like to thank all of them that made this possible!
