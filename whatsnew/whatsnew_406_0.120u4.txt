Source changes:
---------------
- Made some minor changes in the inline code. The result of atomic_add32 isn't used a lot of the time, so the final addition was brought out to allow it to be optimized away. Removed the unnecessary delta argument from atomic_increment32 and atomic_decrement32 in eminline.h, and added implementations.  Changed the condition for using rgbsse.h to include 32-bit platforms with SSE enabled [Vas Crabb].
- Did a major clean-up of the input ports in ssv.c. Brought out the common joystick, mahjong and quiz input setups, and then used PORT_INCLUDE to pull them in when needed. Also brought out the common coinage settings, to avoid needless repetition [Vas Crabb].
- Analyzed all driver interfaces (DRIVER_INIT, READ8_HANDLER, etc.) to determine which ones should be made static and properly tagged them all to reduce global namespace pollution. Some cases turned out to be dead code, which was also properly tagged [Atari Ace].
- Updated the Tube Panic driver, fixing the background scroll-in (it's smooth again now). The problem was caused by wrong synchronization between main and slave CPUs. Also modified the video driver to be scanline accurate and implemented more accurate interrupt handling [Jarek Burczynski].
- Altered TTL low high levels in res_net.c. This will broaden the color range a bit. Since the results are normalized, there is only a limited effect visible [Couriersud].
- Cleaned up inputs and added dip locations in ms32.c. Also fixed dips in "47pie2" and "akiss" [Sonikos].
- Fixed bug that caused incorrect input to be read if multiple inputs were mapped to the same mouse input under Windows [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed a bug in the i8051 core that improperly fired the Timer2 interrupt when it wasn't enabled [Jim Stolis].
- Updates to the peplus driver [Jim Stolis]:
  * Added lightpen support;
  * Added PE+ Superboard support;
  * Added ABC coin optics support;
  * Added full I2C eeprom support;
  * Added NVRAM support;
  * Corrected door closure issues;
  * Removed most memory hacks;
  * Consolidated machines and inputs;
  * New layout for pepp0158.
- Split up the MPU4 driver into a core and driver set up a la NeoGeo. Also made some timer fixes, and added some new ROMs added [James Wallace].
- Fixed problems introduced when the junofrst blitter code was simplified [Chris Hardy].
- American Poker II major rewrite [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Properly dervied clocks from crystals;
  * Reworked TILE_GET_INFO to handle the proper tiles/color codes;
  * Fixed interrupts (NMI);
  * Corrected AY8910 frequency to 1.5 MHz to match the real thing;
  * Arranged the AY8910 volume in all games avoiding clips;
  * Corrected the screen visible area;
  * Added NVRAM support;
  * Reworked the memory map, mapping all the hardware I/O ports;
  * Reworked the Inputs for all sets;
  * Added implementation of Operator and Supervisor Keys;
  * Fixed some timing troubles;
  * Added partial DIP switch support with diplocations to all sets;
  * Removed the hack in DRIVER_INIT;
  * Hooked write handlers for output ports;
  * Added watchdog routines;
  * Dumped, hooked, wired and decoded the color PROM in all sets;
  * Modified the refresh rate according to hardware measurements;
  * Wired the lamps for all sets. Created their respective layouts;
  * Splitted the driver to driver/video;
  * Other minor fixes.
- SCSP fixes [kingshriek]:
  * Fixed DECAY1 envelope state to not exit immediately;
  * Improved support for LPSLNK and SBCTL;
  * Fixed panning calculation bug;
  * Fixed case where key-rate scaling is off.
- Added support for indicating that DIP switches are reversed in the DIP locations view [Vas Crabb].
- Added DIP locations for Midway Tron and the Nintendo Donkey Kong series (dkong.c) [Vas Crabb].
- Added an Altivec/VMX implementation of the RGB utilities for our friends with G4, G5 and POWER5 CPUs (rgbvmx.h) and added rgbint_bilinear_filter and rgbaint_bilinear_filter to rgbsse.h (based on rgb_bilinear_filter/rgba_bilinear_filter) for completeness, as these functions exist in rgbgen.h [Vas Crabb].
- Updated model2.c, taitojc.c, and gticlub.c to use the new polygon routines. Deprecated the old poly.c and renamed polynew.* to poly.* [Aaron Giles].
- Unified poly.c callbacks so that tri and quad callbacks work the same way [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed display of floating point TMS32031 registers in the debugger [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed TMS32031 ABSF opcode to work as documented and not produce a proper negative [Aaron Giles].
