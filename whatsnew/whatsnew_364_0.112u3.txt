Source changes:
---------------
- Modified ledutil to save the LED state when returning from pause [Bob Seidel].
- Fixed the crashing in debug builds and added controls for 'Ski Champ' [Ville Linde].
- Updated makefile to remove the map file when making clean [Dirk Best].
- Significant changes to the input system [Derrick Renaud]:
  * Added the -vol shortcut to -volume to match the docs.
  * Added new joystick options -joy_deadzone & -joy_saturation. Removed -a2d_deadzone. These now apply to the analog and digital-from-analog data. See windows.txt for more info.
  * Analog joystick data is divided into chunks for IPT_POSITIONAL controls. e.g., for a 7 position emulated control, a joystick axis will move 3 positions each way from center + center = 7 positions. One good use for this is 49way sticks. The driver input code just needs to be set to IPT_POSITIONAL PORT_POSITIONS(7) and use a PORT_REMAP_TABLE.
  * IPT_PEDAL controls are now nothing special in the core. They can use any control like a paddle does. At the OS input level, the code has been changed to supply full joystick axis and the +/- axis. This means any half axis or full axis can be used for any emulated control. e.g., a pedal that only outputs Y- data can be used for the full range of the gun in boothill. Or a full axis slider on a joystick can be used in its full range as an emulated pedal. INC now increases the pedal value, not DEC.
  * When seting up the player controls in the menu, the first time an analog joystick axis is selected it will use the full range. If you immediately select the same joystick axis it will toggle to the half +/- axis.
  * Analog joysticks can now simulate relative devices such as a trackball. The further you move the joystick, the faster the trackball spins. Use the sensitivity setting to adjust.
  * Added support for mouse +/- axis to be used as button input.
  * Modified IPT_PADDLE and IPT_AD_STICK so they do not behave as pedals using half the joystick range if their default value is equal to one of the PORT_MINMAX values. Now you can select it as the full or +/- part axis.
- Updates to the acefruit driver [stephh]:
  * Added 'sidewndr' and 'spellbnd' (was 'sidewnda') which were missing in previous releases.
  * Reorganised the layout to have all lamps and solenoids at the top (where there's nothing).
  * Also renamed some lamps and solenoids.
  * Added 'starspnr'; unfortunately, the game is not working due to a bad dump (H11).
- Updated the DISCRETE_OP_AMP_OSCILLATOR circuit to get it ready for a future driver. It allows the DISC_OP_AMP_OSCILLATOR_1 | DISC_OP_AMP_IS_NORTON oscillator to use nodes to adjust the resistance values instead of only being static values [Derrick Renaud].
- Fixed thrust control in Lunar Lander [Derrick Renaud].
- Created new utility module pool.c for managing memory pools. Rebuilt auto_malloc on top of this concept [Nathan Woods].
- Added speedups to many of the Eolith games [David Haywood].
- Added sprite rotation to the realbrk driver. This fixes the jigging reels in the pachinko games and the cue position and orientation in the pool games.
- Added discrete sound for Amazing Maze. Also added new Discrete modules: DISCRETE_LOOKUP_TABLE & DISCRETE_LOGIC_JKFLIPFLOP [Derrick Renaud].
- Fixed the small graphic issues in the Cidelsa driver. Draco still has  imperfect colors [Curt Coder].
- Fixed naming and identification of several Neo Geo ROMs [JohnBoy].
- Fixed regression in the GeeBee driver [David Haywood].
- Major update to the Konami System 573 driver [smf]:
  * Added state saving to emu\sound\cdda.c & mame\drivers\ksys573.c.
  * Added DS2401 emulation.
  * Added X76F100 emulation.
  * Added ZS01 emulation (HLE of System 573 PIC).
  * Added write support to X76F041 emulation.
  * Many new games partially supported.
- Connected brightness support on the CPS1 board (not just CPS2) after verifying that the real board does support it [MAME Italia forum].
- Improved the K001604 tilemap chip emulation [Ville Linde].
- Fixed garbage in fonts on some systems [Aaron Giles].
- Added new tool makemeta.exe, which can generate properly formatted metadata for laserdisc CHDs using either a specially captured AVI as input (preferred) or a hand-crafted set of encoded Philips codes [Aaron Giles].
- Rewrote throttling code to be more forgiving of OSD-level glitches and uneven frame rates [Aaron Giles].
- Changed sound streaming engine to be emulated time based instead of sample based. This means that emulation behavior is independent of the user-specified sample rate (except that some sound cores still use this value; to fixed in a future update). Also separated sound generation from video frame rate. Sound is now pushed to the OSD layer at a fixed rate of 50 updates per emulated second. This entailed a change in the way sound is handed to the OSD layer. Instead of the OSD layer requesting arbitrary numbers of samples each frame, the core now pushes the appropriate number of samples based on the emulated time [Aaron Giles].
- Simplified the OSD interface for sound. Removed osd_start_audio_stream and osd_stop_audio_stream; OSD initialization code is now responsible for initialization. Removed osd_get_mastervolume and osd_sound_enable, keeping management of the main volume in emu/sound.c [Aaron Giles].
- Changed K054539 to run at native sample rate [Aaron Giles].
