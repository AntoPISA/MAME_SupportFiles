  * 88games.c, combatsc.c and rockrage.c.
  * psikyo4.c and psikyosh.c.
- Added driver data struct and save states to [Fabio Priuli]:
  * djboy.c.
  * toratora.c and sf.c.
  * neogeo.c.
  * cps1.c, cps2.c and fcrash.c.
  * cbasebal.c, chinsan.c, mitchell.c and quasar.c.
  * malzak.c.
  * battlnts.c, bladestl.c, crshrace.c and contra.c.
  * f1gp.c, fastlane.c, flkatck.c, hcastle.c, labyrunr.c and suprslam.c.
  * psikyo.c and pgm.c.
- Removed old index-based DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT and then renamed the newer DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT_TAG to replace it. Updated all callers [Aaron Giles].
- Removed all uses of input_port_by_index(), and removed the function [Fabio Priuli, Aaron Giles].
- Added saves to 6522via.c. This fixes problems of gameplan.c and trvquest.c games with -autosave [Fabio Priuli].
- Enabled GAME_SUPPORTS_SAVE flag to dday.c because some of the core changes have fixed the sound problem at loading [Fabio Priuli].
- Imported SAA5050 emulation from MESS and made it a device. Updated malzak.c to use it, removing the almost identical implementation in the driver [Fabio Priuli].
- Added TILE_GET_INFO_DEVICE and SET_TILE_INFO_DEVICE macros to tilemap.c [Fabio Priuli].
- Made MB14241 Shifter IC a device and moved its source to emu/machine. Updated mw8080bw.c and 8080bw.c accordingly. Also converted fgoal.c to use this implementation in place of its own version [Fabio Priuli].
- Enhanced the UML opcodes for LOAD, LOADS, and STORE to support arbitrary scaling factors. Previously, specifying a size implied a scaling factor equal to the size (i.e., specifying DWORD meant the index was scaled by 4). This is still the default. However, now you can specify the scale explicitly for other cases. For example, you can specify DWORD_x1 to fetch a DWORD but don't scale the index at all, or BYTE_x8 to fetch a BYTE while scaling the index by 8. Updated all backends to make this work [Aaron Giles].
- Konami devic-fication and improvements [Fabio Priuli]:
  * Added device versions of all the Konami custom ICs currently emulated in machine/konamiic.c and video/konamiic.c.
  * Updated combatsc.c, contra.c, crshrace.c, f1gp.c, fastlane.c, flkatck.c, hcastle.c, labyrunr.c and suprslam.c to use the new code.
  * Moved k056800 sound device to emu/sound and removed the old code; updated gticlub.c, hornet.c, nwk-tr.c, ultrsprt.c and zr107.c to use this implementation.
  * Updated 88games.c, battlnts.c, bladestl.c and rockrage.c to use new devices.
  * Updated asterix.c and moo.c to use the new devices.
  * Converted aliens.c, blockhl.c, crimfght.c and gbusters.c to use Konami video devices.
  * Updated parodius.c, simpsons.c, thunderx.c, vendetta.c and xexex.c to use the new video devices.
  * Updated overdriv.c to use the Konami video devices.
  * Updated gradius3.c, mainevt.c & gijoe.c to use Konami video devices.
  * Updated ajax.c, bottom9.c, chqflag.c, rollerg.c, spy.c, surpratk.c to use Konami video devices.
  * Updated dbz.c, lethal.c, metro.c, rungun.c, tail2nos.c, tmnt.c, ultraman.c, wecleman.c, xmen.c & zr107.c to use Konami video devices instead of konamiic.h code.
  * Updated bishi.c and djmain.c to use Konami video devices.
  * Updated plygonet.c to use Konami video devices and input_port_write for eepromdev_read_bit.
  * Updated asterix.c, gijoe.c, hornet.c, lethal.c, moo.c, overdriv.c, rungun.c, vendetta.c, xexex.c & xmen.c to use EEPROM device.
  * Updated konamigx.c, tmnt.c and mystwarr.c to use EEPROM device.

- Converted Taito F3 sound to a separate machine driver which is imported into games that use it [Aaron Giles].
- Converted the balsente driver to driver_data structure [Aaron Giles].

- RSP recompiler improvements/optimizations [Harmony]:
  * Split SATURATE_ACCUM into a signed and unsigned version to reduce tack usage.
  * Corrected an issue with the 0h variants of VMRG, VAND, VNAND, VOR, VNOR, VXOR and VNXOR.

- Reworked the hng64 polygon chunk recovery code to be more crash-proof. Documented what's known about the 3d data much better. Fixed vertex  ROM loading for fatfurwa and buriki [Andrew Gardner].
- Converted rtc65271 to a device [Aaron Giles].
- Added "new" command -listdevices (or -ld) to list the devices attached to a driver. I notice that MESS has a command with the same name; hopefully the behaviors can be combined eventually [Aaron Giles].
- Got rid of explicit resource tracking for state saving. Now we just use the auto_ allocators, since registration is restricted to initialization [Aaron Giles].
- Moved machine->gfx initialization out of the video module and into drawgfx. We now call this before devices are initialized, so that devices can dynamically append to the machine->gfx as needed [Aaron Giles].
