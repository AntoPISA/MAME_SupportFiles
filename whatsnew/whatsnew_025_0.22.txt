--------------------------------------
Sorry to be late, but this is my birthday MAME release and I wanted it to be as good as possible. Enjoy, and send a postcard if you like ;)  NdMix.


New games supported
-------------------
(commando) Commando [Nicola Salmoria]

(gng)      Ghost 'n Goblin [Roberto Ventura, Mirko Buffoni]
(phoenix)  Phoenix [Nicola Salmoria]
(vulgus)   Vulgus [Mirko Buffoni]

New clone supported:
--------------------
(pacplus)  Pac Man Plus [Mirko Buffoni]


Program changes:
----------------
- Added high score support to Amidar and Frogger [Mirko Buffoni].
- Added Phoenix Amstar (clone) support, Pac Man Plus (clone) and fixed all Invader's clones bugs. Also fixed charset of all Invader's clones [Mirko Buffoni].
- Added preliminary sound support to Elevator Action and Jungle King. Tarzan yell scream sample missing [Mirko Buffoni].
- Added Vulgus support. Colors are wrong unless I find the color proms. High score save supported. I played around with DIP switches: they are almost right, though, but there should be also a sound toggle while in attract mode [Mirko Buffoni].
- And here it is: thanks to Roberto Ventura's superdetailed documentation I'v added 'Ghost 'n Goblin' support. I lost one week because of a bug in the new 6809 emulator, so I switch back to the previous one. Big thanks to Nicola that fixed some stupid bugs in color palette generation. ;) We need a skilled player. READ THE README.TXT FILE! [Roberto Ventura, Mirko Buffoni].
- Another one added: based on GnG hardware I'v added 'Diamond Run' support. Don't know if the banks mode switch is right, it's too slow for me to go further the first level! [Mirko Buffoni].
- Brad Oliver provided me a lot of suggestions to improve portability and fixed a lot of bugs [Brad Oliver, Mirko Buffoni].
- Fixed credit bugs in Elevator Action and Turtles. REMEMBER TO DELETE THE PREVIOUS .DSW FILES OTHERWISE THE GAMES WON'T WORK PROPERLY! [Mirko Buffoni].
- I have fixed colors in Centipede. Thanks to  Ivan for sending me the info [Ivan Mackintosh, Mirko Buffoni]
- Nicola added cars in radar update of Rally X and improved color palette emulation in 'Bombjack' which has now perfect colors.
- Nicola added COMMANDO!! Another of my favourite games back to life ;) High score supported as well. Original Sound is done by YM2203 (FM synthesis) while now is done by 8910 (no FM). So music is not present [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed some colors of Congo Bongo. They are not right but a lot better of the previous. Screenshots could be useful [Paul Berberich].
- Proposed a better optimization to Cpu_readmem and Cpu_writemem. Speed results are good under DOS and Windows [Rick Wirch].
- Some fixes to sprite priority in Frogger [Mirko Buffoni].
- Time Pilot has now 100% correct colors [Mirko Buffoni, Virtu-Al!].


Sources changes:
----------------
- Provided modifications to MSDOS.C for Vesa 2.0 linear and banked extensions. Also inline assembly double pixeling provided a faster approach on slower videocards. Check the readme.txt file for new video options [Bernd Wiebelt].
- Changed CPUIntrf regarding readmem/writemem optimizations [Mirko Buffoni].
- Minor fixes to some drivers [Mirko Buffoni].
