Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed Casino 5 hang on the Horse Racing game [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed compile quirk with Funcube2/4 [Angelo Salese].
- Added minor additional information and OSC info to volfied driver. Also added two BPROMs not included before [Brian Troha].
- Opcode accesses are now marked debugger_access. This is important with the recent changes to automatically call the read handler if the opcode base cannot be found. Changed logging for non-RAM opcode bases so that it does not output in the case of debugger_access being set [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed logic for deriving direct ranges so that it uses the non-watchpoint-infected tables for its lookups [Aaron Giles].
- Changed memory_set_direct_region to pass the address returned from the DIRECT_UPDATE_HANDLER back to the memory read function [smf].
- 6850acia: Only adjust the rx/tx bit timers on a control write if the divide ratios have changed [Phil Bennett].
- Added the ability to invoke CPU input lines with devcb callbacks. Changed sp0256 to use devcb callbacks. Updated sauro driver to use this new feature [Nathan Woods].
- Added PCB layout for Funcube and corrected ROM names based on a hi-res photo of the PCB [Brian Troha].
- Improve disassembly of R3000 code that uses the TLB or FPU [R. Belmont].
- Added new game Number Dieci [Mirko Buffoni]:
  * Seems a IGS poker hack to comply with 2000's Italian law
  * Sound synthesys have been replaced by OKIM ADPCM samples.
  * Some patched out routines have been recovered to allow test mode dsw mapping.
  * Mapped Stelle e Cubi to this memory map, something shows but graphic is from a bad dump.
- Added new game PK Tetris [Mirko Buffoni]:
  * Strange game with an amusement part (sort of Tetris mixed with Poker).
  * Amuse input not mapped, may be necessary for the amusement part which can be disabled via DSW.
- Fixed various issues with 'Il Pagliaccio' driver [Angelo Salese]:
  * Fixed ROM source reading for the blitter.
  * Properly use height/width params for the blitter.
  * Hooked up the backup ram;
  * Added basic inputs.
  * Removed deprecat.h dependancy.
- Moved over some of the AGEMAME drivers [David Haywood, thanks to James Wallace/ageMAME].
- Further fixes with 'Il Pagliaccio' blitter [Angelo Salese]:
  * Fixed Transparency pens.
  * Fixed color pens for the charset.
- Merged 'Strip Teaser' and 'Il Pagliaccio' driver, fixed the layer clearance for both and added a preliminary MCU simulation for the former [Angelo Salese].
- Relaxed 8 letter setname limitation for clone sets - this is designed to make it easier to add simple suffixes to clone names without truncating the original set name, it isn't designed to be abused and used as an alternate description [Olivier Galibert].
- Made the 6522 VIA implementation use devcb [Nathan Woods].
- Changed 6526cia to use devcb [Nathan Woods].
- Added redumped sound CPU ROM for Sega Water Ski [Brian Troha].
- Added original Super Poker 115IT: Added because 3 Super 8 have SUPER POKER 115IT string inside. 3Super8 may be a hack, strings are the same, but code is different though still partially encrypted [Mirko Buffoni].
- Added "global column coloring" for Super Draw Poker, colors are now 100% accurate [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed disassembler for CPUs with address bus shifts [Aaron Giles].
- TMS57002 preliminary implementation [Olivier Galibert].
- Added digital i/o board layout & initial information on the memory card board to the Konami System 573 driver [smf].
- Added redumped non JEDEC roms to Rock 'n Rage (World) [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Added extensive readme doc to the Sega X Board driver [Guru].
- Decrypted a large number of games in goldstar.c and sfbonus.c [Olivier Galibert].
- WIP mario update with some FIXMEs [Couriersud, Smitdogg]:
  * Created custom module for run sounds. Running the discrete sound system at 480KHz was not really optimal.
  * Reviewed parts list, schematics and pcb pictures
  * Brought mario run sound in line with recordings from Smitdogg.
  * VCO voltage needs to be 0V for this to happen. Verification outstanding
  * Capacitors needed some ageing applied as well. To be removed once the VCO issue is clarified.
- Refactored the ACIA6850 to use devcb [Curt Coder].
- Added a patch to Jackie driver, game now works [Mirko Buffoni]:
  * Added complete reel emulation (thanks to Luca, Angelo and David drivers studied to better understand hardware similarities).
  * Press T to toggle amuse game, used to mask gambling activities.
- Added 'Champion League' [Mirko Buffoni]:
  * Same encryption and patches used in Numero10, but on standard IGS Poker V220I board
  * Reworked expansion ROM memory map handler.
- Added effect sound banking, coin counters and sprites - sprites priority to silkroad [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Made a bunch of improvements to the goldstar driver now that the sets are decrypted [David Haywood].
- Revisited seibu decryption [Nicola Salmoria].
- Converted all sound chips into proper devices. Merged the sound chip interface into the device interface, removing any differences (such as the whole ALIASing concept) [Aaron Giles].
- Modified every sound chip in the following ways [Aaron Giles]:
  * Updated to match the device interface.
  * Reduced read/write handlers down to the minimal number.
  * Added the use of get_safe_token() for ensuring correctness.
  * Other minor cleanup.
- Removed the custom sound device. The additional work to just make custom sound cases into full devices is minimal, so I just converted them all over to be actual devices [Aaron Giles].
- Vastly simplified the sound interfaces, removing the ghastly sndti_* business and moving everyone over to using tags for sound identity. sndintrf, like cpuintrf, is now just a header file with no implementation [Aaron Giles].
- Modified each and every driver that references a sound chip [Aaron Giles]:
  * All memory maps explicitly reference the targeted device via AM_DEVREAD/AM_DEVWRITE/AM_DEVREADWRITE.
  * 16-bit and 32-bit accesses to 8-bit chips no longer use trampoline functions but instead use the 8-bit AM_DEVREAD/WRITE macros.
  * All references to sound chips are now done via TAGs.
  * Note that these changes are brute force, not optimal; in many cases drivers should grab pointers to devices in MACHINE_START and stash them away.
- Fixed a couple of dipswitches for Progress [Brian Troha].
- goldstar.c improvements [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Full inputs and DIP switches from the scratch for schery97, schery97a and skill98.
  * Changed the sets description to match the program version.
  * Cleaned-up the game driver zone for better organization purposes.
  * Added GAME_NO_SOUND flag to schery97, schery97a and skill98.
  * Added some program version notes.
- Fixed a contact MAMEDEV message in cps1.c [Nicola Salmoria].
- Changed sfbonus to use tilemaps [David Haywood].
- Added sound and some scrolling registers to the sfbonus driver.Added flipx and basic inputs to the sfbonus.c driver [Angelo Salese].
- Updated the wheelfir.c driver with some additional information [Brian Troha].
- Correct ROM names and PCB locations in the twincobr driver. Corrected and added missing proms for Flying Shark (and clones) [Brian Troha, Stefan Lindberg].
- Merged brasil.c and highvdeo.c drivers [Angelo Salese].
- Added basic support of RP5C01 to remove (most) protection kludges in 'Super Punchout' [Nicola Salmoria, Bob Seidel].
- Added correct Midnight Run ROM names [Guru].
- Added Read Parameter Register support to the hd63484. Moved logging behind a define [Phil Bennett].
- Added PCB layout for Zoar. Corrected AY-3-8910 clocks and added missing PROM [Guru].
- More improvements to goldstar.c [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added 3 new machine drivers for the different Amcoe games hardware.
  * Added OKI M6295 support for speech/sounds to schery97, schery97a, skill98, pokonl97 and match98.
  * Fixed sound support to nfb96, nfb96a, nfb96b, nfb96c, nfb96txt, roypok96, roypok96a, roypok96b, nc96, nc96a, nc96b, nc96c, nc96txt, nfb96se, nfb96sea, nfb96seb, carb2002 and carb2003.
  * Full inputs & DIP switches from the scratch for pokonl97, match98, nfb96, nfb96a, nfb96b, nfb96c, nfb96txt, roypok96, roypok96a, roypok96b, nc96, nc96a, nc96b, nc96c, nc96txt, nfb96se, nfb96sea, nfb96seb, carb2002 and carb2003. All these were promoted to working state.
  * Fixed size and position of tilemaps visible area to match98.
  * More driver cleanups.
- Cidelsa changes [Curt Coder]:
  * Combined CDP1869 video and sound parts to one device.
  * Refactored CDP1852 to use devcb.
- Fixed input in hanaawas (note: for the second playere used mahjong input like A,B,C....), also fixed yes/no button in hanaroku [Sonikos].
- Changes safarir CPU to 8085A, the disassembly has 8085A-specific code that an 8080 can't execute [Luigi30].
- Removed some unused code from deco_mlc.c [Christophe Jaillet].
- Added PALs and readme to midxunit.c [Guru].
- Properly added the PPI8255 devices to Pit Boss and reorganized the inputs in these two games [Angelo Salese].
- Corrected memory map for gardiab and promoted it to working [Angelo Salese].
- Added the ability for devices to have their own custom inline config management. This was primarily added to allow for sound routes to be supported in a way that is compatible with the current driver structure. A device can now define a DEVICE_CUSTOM_CONFIG callback which is called whenever one of the MCONFIG_TOKEN_DEVICE_CONFIG_CUSTOM_* tokens is encountered. A special token MCONFIG_TOKEN_DEVICE_CONFIG_CUSTOM_FREE is defined to clean up memory allocated and/or reset the custom configuration, and is called when the device is torn down to allow for memory cleanup [Aaron Giles].
- Various improvements to Far West (Iron Horse bootleg) [Tomasz Slanina].
