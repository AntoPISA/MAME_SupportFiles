Source changes:
---------------
- avr8.c: Added FMUL, FMULS, and FMULSU opcodes [MooglyGuy]:

- avr8.c: Converted to modern CPU device [MooglyGuy].
- New driver for Super Card. Encrypted custom Fun World CPU based on Z80 family, plus 2x 8255 PPI, and YM3812 / Y3014 for sound. The status is still preliminary [Roberto Fresca].
- Fixed cd and root counter irq's [smf].
- z8000: Fixed implementation of trdb, trdrb, trib, trirb, trtdb, trtdrb, trtib, trtirb instructions [Christian Grössler].
- suprloco.c: Made Rev A the parent set. Added DIP switch locations to the 'Super Locomotive' sets. Added minor documentation about basic PCB parts [Brian Troha].
- Decrypted graphics in Saint Dragon (set 2) [Luca Elia].
- cpu.mak: Allow overriding tmsmake/m68kmake for easier cross-compilation and testing of alternatives [Robert Muth].
- netlist: Symbols starting with _ are reserved in many BSD-derived environments [Robert Muth].
- itech32.c: Major ROM renaming to get away from the DOS 8.3 convention to accurately reflect what's on the labels [Brian Troha].
- Normalize some include paths to always include video/ or machine/ as necessary [Robert Muth].
- konicdev: Fix weird do-nothing lines that cause Clang warnings [Robert Muth].
- Mega Lines: Added PCB, bipolar PROMs circuitry and DIP switches layouts. Also added some technical notes and cleaned up a bit the code [Roberto Fresca, Team Europe].
- Added tile flipping, dips, cleaned up a few bits for Planet Probe. Now marked as working.  Old pprobe.c driver no longer needed [David Haywood].
- Added DIP locations to vastar.c driver [Tafoid].
- 6502: Rewrite modern, cycle-exact and interruptible [Olivier Galibert].
- m6800.c: Workaround for Coleco Adam not booting. The free-running counter values are unacceptable, so let it read from the output compare register instead. To be fixed properly later [Curt Coder].
- m6502: IRQ fixes [Olivier Galibert].
- avr8.c: Renamed io map to data map, routed ports through io map. Implemented ST Z+ and SBIW opcodes [MooglyGuy].

- Decrypted code in Harem [Luca Elia].
- tms5220&friends: Change chirp waveform to match the chip more closely, acoustically. This will require completion of a pending decap to verify as correct, but it certainly sounds better. [Lord Nightmare].
- tms5220.c: Got rid of most of the excitation (voicing) hacks. The rest is mostly making the space/tabs for comments more consistent and fixing a couple of spelling errors in the comments. Minor bugfix regarding the time_to_ready code [Lord Nightmare].
