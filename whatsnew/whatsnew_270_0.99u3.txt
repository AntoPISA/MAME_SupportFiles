Source changes:
---------------
- Updates to the ST-V driver [Mariusz Wojcieszek]:
  * vdp2: Added rotation in RBG0 layer (improves diehard, vfkids, vfremix, thunt, sassisu backgrounds).
  * vdp2: Added 15bit RGB tilemaps (used by thunt).
  * vdp2: Added opaque alpha blended bitmaps (fixes missing gfx in shienryu intro).
  * vdp2: Added enable bit for RGB sprites (fixes some bad sprites in vfremix).
  * vdp2: added alpha blending for RGB sprites.
  * vdp1: Fixed polygon drawing. Added line drawing.
  * sh2: Fixed bug in division unit. added callback called when cpu reads FTCSR register (intended for idle loop skipping for slave sh2 in stv).
  * stv: Added idle loop skipping for several games.
  * dsp:  Fixed dma (fixes some bad gfx in thunt).
- Added dsp56k CPU core and hooked it up to the Polygonet Commanders driver [Andrew Gardner].
- SCSI hard disk updates [R. Belmont]:
 * Added FORMAT UNIT, READ (6 byte), WRITE (6 byte), READ (12 byte), MODE SENSE, and READ CAPACITY commands.
  * Changed INQUIRY to ID as a real Seagate model, which makes MacOS much happier than a manufacturer code of "MAME".
  * Some MESS-specific tweeks to initialization.
- Fixed all the volume table calculations in the YMF271 core [Ville Linde].
- SPI Improvements [Ville Linde, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]:
  * Added real coin inputs. The previously used coin input was service coin
  * Hooked up eeprom in rdft2us, rfjetus and rdft22kc.
- Fixed recent LSI53C810 update which caused the Model 3 games to crash
[Ville Linde].
- Fixed PowerPC recompiler so that Scud Race works again [Ville Linde].
- Significant overhaul of the user interface infrastructure [Aaron Giles]:
  * All user interface rendering is now cached until the end and rendered in one pass.
  * A large number of extraneous and redundant functions have been removed and replaced with a smaller set of more flexible APIs.
  * Global access to the UI fonts and colortables is now gone, they are private to the user interface code.
  * All global user interface function names have been normalized. Most importantly, usrintf_showmessage is now ui_popup.
  * Pause behavior has been redefined; instead of sitting in a tight loop, the code proceeds normally, but the CPU execution system does not advance time.
  * Code for the menus has been reworked; some menus are temporarily not available (cheats, memory cards).
  *Removed the internal display of history.dat.
- Cramming this kind of data into MAME's limited UI is not really useful, and viewing the history.dat information is supported by many frontends and websites [Aaron Giles].
- Removed the following obsolete and/or redundant command line options from the Windows build [Aaron Giles]:

- Removed the "Press any key" prompts when displaying ROM warnings. Instead, a warning about bad/missing ROMs is now displayed on the warnings screen. Details of the bad/missing ROMs are still printed to the console [Aaron Giles]
