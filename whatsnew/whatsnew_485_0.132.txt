MAME Testers Bugs Fixed (3):
---------------------------
- 03013: [Misc.] [debug] "Error: free a non-existant block" on TMS57002 source generation (Atari Ace)
- 03238: [Crash/Freeze] gtmr and clones: Access Violation (Tafoid)
- 03241: [DIP/Input] aladbl: Unable to "Press Start" (Fabio Priuli)


Source changes:
---------------
- Added missing static and const qualifiers throughout the source [Atari Ace].
- Added the concept of device contracts. A contract is a well-defined set of interfaces supported by a device, and identified by a unique string identifier. A device may support any number of contracts described in a list via the DEVICE_CONTRACT_LIST* macros. The purpose of contracts is to provide a means for devices to expose a standard set of interfaces to other parts of the system. For example, the PCI device should expose a contract that includes functions for configuration register access, and 32-bit I/O. Then any device with a PCI interface should implement the PCI contract, so that the PCI bus device can route things appropriately [Aaron Giles].
- Changed several internal interfaces to be more consistent, namely.
  * Passing device_config as a const always;
  * Passing running_machine as a non-const always;
  * Eliminating running_machine where possible;
  * Passing machine/device first;
  * Preferring (screen, bitmap, cliprect) over (machine, bitmap, cliprect) when all are needed for rendering [Atari Ace].
- Fixed a minor typo in the SSEM debugging features [MooglyGuy].
- Fixed a number of year listings known to be unknown or incorrect the current MAME source. The source for these changes come from the book: Arcade TV Game List (Edition: Domestic and Overseas, 1971 - 2005) [Tafoid, Fujix].
- Fixed address line swapping in Mirax [Olivier Galibert].
- Fixed colors in the Aristocrat Mark-IV driver [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed for good the colors in 86 Lions [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed minor cycle counting inaccuracy in Z80 core [Marshmellow].
- Fixed ROM 2 decryption in Mirax [Tomasz Slanina].
- Hooked up 2nd player mahjong panel in mjkjidai [Angelo Salese].
- Improved the video emulation in Mirax [Angelo Salese].
- Removed the MDRV_<devtype>_REMOVE macros. A simple DEVICE_REMOVE works now that device types are not needed [Aaron Giles].
- Update ghosteo driver with information out of eolith.c about QS1000 and added the sample rom, with a note about it NOT being dumped from this PCB but is a common sample ROM used by Eolith [Brian Troha].
- Verified clocks on Samurai Aces PCB [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Watchdog hooked up in twinkle.c so test mode exits [smf].
