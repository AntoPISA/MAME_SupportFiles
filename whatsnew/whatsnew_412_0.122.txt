Source changes:
---------------
- Continued to add const qualifiers on remaining items in the project [Atari Ace].
- Added explicit clears on Neo Geo initialization [David Haywood].
- Neo Geo updates [johnboy]:
  * Added Neo-Geo game pcb info;
  * Corrected a number of incorrect ROMs;
  * Added MVS VERSION tag to fightfva, renamed 'P'-rom;
  * Added MVS AND AES VERSION tag to joyjoy;
  * Added AES VERSION tag to kof99;
  * Added MVS VERSION tag to kof99a.
- Cleaned up input ports for cave.c and rpunch.c [Sonikos].
- Another big dkong.c driver update [Couriersud]:
  * Wrote M58817 sound driver and hooked it up. Uses tms5110 speech synthesis. LPC format is identical, however coefficients seem to be different. Until coefficients are known, samples are used;
  * Changed dkong/radarscp based games to use hardware-conformant I8035 memory maps;
  * Added drakton clone drktnjr on dkongjr hardware;
  * Noved address remapping proms to REGION_USER1 (hunchbkd & co);
  * Service now adds credit;
  * Hooked up coin_counters;
  * remove GAME_NOT_WORKING GAME_WRONG_COLORS from hunchbkd;
  * dkongjr: mapped more interface lines between sound and cpu boards;
  * Tagged all inputs, all reads use tag names;
  * Moved more static vars into dkong_state.
- More major SCSP fixes [kingshriek]:
  * Rewrote much of the interpolation code;
  * Improved key-rate scaling calculation;
  * Fixed playback of non-looping samples with a zero loop-end address;
  * Fixed backwards looping mode so that it initially reads forward until encountering the loop-start address;
  * Preliminary but reasonable-sounding FM support;
  * Fixed overflow in frequency calculation;
  * Improved FM, but it's disabled for now because it doesn't sound right yet;
  * Improved DSP wet/dry mix (should be correct now);
  * Fixed a minor LPSLNK problem.
- Fixed Hopper Empty and Coin-Out Timeout issues in the peplus.c driver [Jim Stolis].
- Removed obsolete crosshair code [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Fixed several minor memory leaks [Oliver Stoneberg].
