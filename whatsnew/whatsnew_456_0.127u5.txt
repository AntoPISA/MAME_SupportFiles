Source Changes
--------------
- Added newest Naomi 2 BIOS [Brian Troha].
- Correct NeoGeo M1 decryption for all CMC50 sets [Andreas Naive].
- Rewrite of the Motorola DSP56k disassembler [Andrew Gardner]:
  * Removes arbitrary opcode groupings in favor of flat decode model;
  * Fixes a number of small issues with unknown opcodes;
  * Added the final ALU parallel move ops;
  * Fixes branch relative offset decoding.
- NB1/NB2: Fix default DIPs, added diplocations, used latest idioms. IMPORTANT: you must delete all cfg and nv files for these games [R. Belmont].
- Removed sprite to tile priority in firefox, it doesn't exist [smf].
- System 23 updates [R. Belmont]:
  * Fixed text layer to show (colors are wrong);
  * Added very preliminary support for Gorgon H/W;
  * Added Rapid River readme;
  * Adjusted Gorgon H/W MIPS clock to 133 MHz based on readme;
  * Renamed GP500 to 500GP, which is it's correct name;
  * Fixed sound CPU shared RAM. Comms not yet correct.
- 65816/377xx: Fix disassembly of BRL [ShimaPong].
- Fixed AF calculation in mcs48 [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed Leland ay8910/12 output combining [Couriersud].
- rescale_notifier() changed to always allow rescaling for screenless drivers [Wilbert Pol].
- Added 22VP931 emulation, which is mostly working. Communication works fine and basic searching/playback/skipping is functional. Still a bit glitchy [Aaron Giles].
- Firefox improvements [Aaron Giles]:
  * Memory map is complete from schematics;
  * Gutted laserdisc hacks in favor of actual laserdisc implementation;
  * Fixed all CPU and sound clocks;
  * Removed need for deprecat.h.
- Added generic timer devices, which simply allocate a timer but don't prime it. This is the preferred method for allocating timers, and may eventually be the only mechanism for doing so in the future [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed copy + paste error in geebeeg romset [David Haywood].
- Move dkong memory_region calls into initialization routines [Couriersud].
- Fixed -listroms to know about device-specific ROMs [Aaron Giles].
- Another pass to make static functions static, almost entirely affecting code added in the last few months to MAME.  The fixes are the usual lot, changing enum definitions so they aren't declared, decorating dead code/declarations with #if...#endif, and of course, adding static where appropriate.  In addition, I fixed a bunch of UNUSED_FUNCTON symbols to be spelled correctly (I didn't introduce this) [Atari Ace].
- More system1.c input cleanups [Sonikos].
- Naomi update [Samuele Zannoli]:
  * Now show the contents of the framebuffer if the 3d accelerator is not used so that now the atomiswave logo and messages are shown (if you wait enough);
  * Removed a maple bug (no more strange messages in cvs2gd);
  * Improveed documentation of the communication registers with the dimm board;
  * If DEBUG_VERTICES is defined as 1 the vertices sent to the tile accelerator are collected and then drawn connected by a segment to give a wireframe-like view of the scene.
- Minor optimization to fillbitmap when non-zero fills are done [Christophe Jaillet].
- Moved memory_region() call (which is slow) out of core sprite loop in the neogeo renderer, giving a dramatic speed boost [Christophe Jaillet].
