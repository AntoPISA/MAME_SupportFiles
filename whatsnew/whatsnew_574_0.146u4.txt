Source changes:
---------------
- vsnes.c: Corrected dipswitch settings for 'Vs. Wrecking Crew' and 'Vs. Balloon Fight' [Brian Troha].
- pacman.c: Give Birdiy it's own and correct dipswitch settings [Brian Troha].
- decocass.c: Add correct dipswitch setting for 'Fishing (DECO Cassette)' [Brian Troha].
- gcpinbal.c: Added dipswitch locations to 'Grand Cross Pinball' [Brian Troha].
- gunpey.c: Added dipswitch locations to 'Gunpey' [Brian Troha].
- seta.c: Added dipswitch locations to 'Masked Riders Club Battle Race' [Brian Troha].
- metro.c: Corrected and explained the DIP Switches in Dharma Doujou [Brian Troha].
- galdrvr.c: fixed fantastc colors with a redumped prom [Marcello Mancini].
- aristmk6.c: Cleaned up ROM names and corrected spelling of 'Crystal Springs'. '50 Lions' parent/clone swapped (Australian set is now parent) [Heihachi_73].
- Improved 'Last Bank' driver, added bare-bones graphics and inputs [Angelo Salese].
- Makyosen was redumped with corrected ROM names which are now documented in driver [Yohji, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union].
- Dumped missing u11 gfx ROM in 'Last Bank' [Smitdogg, The Dumping Union].
- Basic device-ization of the TC0091LVC [Angelo Salese].
- PALs for 'Vigilante' have been added, but not hooked up yet.  The old PAL(4m) has been determined to be bad [Corrado Tomaselli].
- dsp32c changes [Phil Bennett]:
  * Set the PCR to 1 on reset.
  * Update the PDF/PIF output pin states only when reading/writing the PDR/PIR registers.
  * Implemented the goto_pde, goto_pdf, goto_pif and goto_pdf instructions.
- harddriv updates [Phil Bennett]:
  * Implemented diagnostic jumper and DIP switches for all games.
  * Added a workaround to prevent racedrivb1 and racedrivg1 from crashing on boot.
  * Use the common 68681 DUART implementation.
  * Use XTAL values for CPU clocks.
- legionna.c: Added priority BPROM to the 'Heated Barrel' sets. Corrected ROM names and added PCB locations [Smitdogg, The Dumping Union].
- PORT_ADJUSTER now accepts PORT_MINMAX as well [Couriersud].
- Implemented a generic implementation to model discrete net lists [Couriersud]:
  * Based on timeslot modelling, the implementation models gate delays in logic chips.
  * Design ready to be split into a generic and a MAME implementation part.
  * Design prepared to merge in discrete components from discrete.
  * Supports code based as well as external net list parsing. Ultimately, net lists and discrete emulation should share one code base. The class design was set up to accomplish this. There is no point in having multiple 555, 7474 implementations around. Most of the code will be moved to lib/netlist going forward to allow usage in other projects.
- 'Pong' now uses netlist.h. This implementation reproduces all gate timing and 555 related effects as described by Dr. H. Holden in his 2012 publication "ATARI PONG E CIRCUIT ANALYSIS & LAWN TENNIS" [Couriersud].
- cshooter.c: Added dipswitch locations to the 'Air Raid' and 'Cross Shooter' sets [Brian Troha].
- tlcs900: Added support for TMP95C063 [Ville Linde].
- taitotz.c: Major driver update [Ville Linde]:
  * Modernized address maps.
  * Improved 2D rendering.
  * Hooked up IO CPU comms.
  * Hooked up IDE controller.
  * Basic 3D graphics emulation.
- metro.c: Corrected OKI6295 Pin 7 assignment for the 'Last Fort' and 'Sky Alert' sets as listed in the driver. Also verified the Pin 7 assignment where listed in the driver [Brian Troha].
- Hooked up TC0091LVC device to Fruit Dream [Angelo Salese].
- midwunit.c: Corrected the ROM labels for 'Open Ice' and added notes about the specific "L" revision of the roms [Brian Troha].
- Enable support building the bundled 7z library with a C++ compiler [Markus Rathgeb].
- Did a first-pass clone creation/set split for the acesp.c driver.  As a result, another 500 or so sets have been added to the gamelist [David Haywood].
- Converted Taito JC 3D renderer to use polynew.h [Ville Linde].
- SDL: Use XInput to allow multiple lightguns on Linux/*BSD targets [Markus Rathgeb, based on a patch by SpritesMods.com].
- sfbonus.c: Corrected dipswitches for the driver and added dipswitch locations [Brian Troha].
- pokechmp.c [David Haywood]:
  * Finally figured out the 8bpp BG tile plane order, a bit odd, guess there are swapped lines.
  * Hooked up OKI sound banking.
  * Fixed sprite attributes.
  * Simplified CPU banking.
  * Use generic palette functions.
- Added sound ROM bankswitch in Combat School bootleg [Angelo Salese].
- Added some new ROMs Twister Sound [Guitar].
- Removed a sound kludge to 'Combat School' [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed gameplay inputs and cleaned up I/Os in 'Cyber Tank' [Angelo Salese].
- cybertnk.c [David Haywood]:

- Fixed AMD/ASD opcodes in the F8 CPU core. Status flags are set before the decimal correction factor is added, so only the carry flag is significant after a decimal addition opcode [Sean Riddle].
- cobra.c: Converted the 3D renderer to use polynew.h [Ville Linde].
