Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed Pachi Fever ADPCM test regression [Angelo Salese].
- Added ATTR_NOTNULL to DAC sound calls [Nathan Woods].
- Decrypted new opcodes for Fire Barrel [Chris Hardy].
- Fixed regressed rowscroll effect for Fire Barrel [Angelo Salese].
- Corrected gfx bitplane for Astro Wars [Angelo Salese].
- Device-ized the SID code [Nathan Woods].
- Apache 3 improvements [Phil Bennett/Guru]:
  * Experimental road layer emulation (currently disabled);
  * Fixed text layer alignment;
  * Corrected CPU clock frequencies;
  * Fixed YM-2151 volume;
  * Added road stripe PROM.
- Removed EEPROM from bzone [Couriersud].
- Impemented CRCL command in hd63484 (used in skattv test mode) [robiza].
- Added save state support to tomcat, tempest, quantum, asteroid, bwidow, mhavoc, omegrace [Couriersud].
- Device-ified the Atari mathbox [Couriersud].
- Device-ified the Atari vector generators [Couriersud].
- Added register SXFER (0x05) to the 53c810 - Nothing more. This reg determines SCSI transfer speeds. scud/scuda now fatalerror with writes to reg # 0x70 [Couriersud].
- Added mtonic decryption [Olivier Galibert].
- Provided color prom to 'Cow Race' [Tomasz Slanina, Angelo Salese].
- Quick hack to delay installing the spu dma handler until the first write to the spu as driver init is now called after the devices are created [smf].
- Added discrete filtering and fixing to bking.c [Couriersud].
- Added some missing robadv2 sets to sfbonus.c [David Haywood].
- Partially fixed asurabld/asurabus sound regression [Phil Bennett].
- XTAL and divisors for rocnrope verified in schematics [Couriersud].
- Added a debug viewer for the blitter-based gfxs in the itgambl3.c [Angelo Salese].
- Added a debug viewer for the blitter-based gfxs in the itgambl2.c [Angelo Salese].
- Renamed a number of commonly-used but confusing device tags. The plan is to move away from generic names like "main" to names that capture the device type as well. This will allow searches for devices to be based on tags alone. Added validity checks to prevent the continuance of this pattern (which I started :), and to ensure that all devices have unique tags, regardless of type [Aaron Giles]:
  * Changes:
  
  CPU/"main" -> "maincpu"
  CPU/"audio" -> "audiocpu"
  CPU/"sound" -> "soundcpu"
  SCREEN/main -> "screen" (since it's the only one)
  SPEAKER/"left" -> "lspeaker"
  SPEAKER/"right" -> "rspeaker"
  SCREEN/"left" -> "lscreen"
  SCREEN/"right" -> "rscreen"
  SCREEN/"middle" -> "mscreen"
  SCREEN/"center" -> "cscreen"
  
- Corrected ROM names in tnzs.c for older TNZS sets [Brian Troha].
- Hooked up the reel background colour writes to cherry master / new Fruit Bonus '96, etc [David Haywood].
- Fixed ROM loading in secretab [Angelo Salese].
- Added BellFruit Scorpion 1, Bellfruit System 85, Maygay M1B and Maygay M2 systems from AGEMAME. MPU4 Mechanical improvements have been made, making mpu4.c the mechanical driver, and mpu4drvr the non-mechanical one. This only leaves JPM impact (mechanical skeleton), Maygay M2 and MPU3 (mechanical skeleton) to be ported from the AGEMAME codebase. There's also been a cleanup sweep on Scorpion2, we were declaring too many versions of the same function, and the reel drawing code had stopped working. Both of these are now fixed [James Wallace].

- Added correct ROMs for Super Triv III [Smitdogg].
- Fixed mjelctrn DSW read handler to agree with new tags [Fabio Priuli].
- Added support for the /PC output pin to the CIA emulation [Dirk Best].
