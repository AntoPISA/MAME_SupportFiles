0.81u8 2004/04/27 [#180 - David Haywood]
----------------------------------------
Private release due to some code cleanups being needed.


New Games Added or Promoted from GAME_NOT_WORKING Status
--------------------------------------------------------
Atari Mini Golf (prototype) [Stefan Jokisch]
Inca (clone of Maya) [ClawGrip]
	
New Non-Working Games / Clones supported
----------------------------------------
MACS (Multi Amenity Cassette System) [David Haywood] (1)
Namco FL (Speed Racer / Final Lap R) [R. Belmont] (2)

Notes:
------
(1): Unknown CPU, seems to be z80 based (16-bit?) with extra opcodes.
(2): Preliminary emulation (doesn't get very far) to test i960 core.


Source changes:
---------------
- 386 updates [Nathan Woods]:
  * Implemented usage of segment limits (or whatever they are called);
  * Implemented 16-bit interrupts;
  * Initial values of IDTR are now properly specified;
  * i386_interrupt() is no longer called when i386_set_irq_line() is called with a state of zero;
  * Actual cycle count is now returned;
  * Partially implemented far CALL and JMP instruction;
  * Implemented PUSH rm8 instruction.
- i960 cpu core / disassembler [Olivier Galibert, R.Belmont, Farfetch'd].
- SPI Improvements [Ville Linde]:
  - SPI:
  * The "old" video hardware (viperp1) does have 3 layers after all, but no rowscroll. Fixed.
  - 386:
  * Bugfixed Nathan's REP.
- Fixed YMF271 pitch: Improves music in Brave Blade [Ville Linde].
- Fixed small fileio problem [Nathan Woods].
- 386 updates [Nathan Woods]:
  * Added a distinction between maskable and non maskable interrupts (like int 3, illegal instruction etc);
  * Added a distinction between invalid and unimplemented instructions. Invalid instructions raise an interrupt, and unimplemented instructions call osd_die() for now;
  * i386_set_irq_line() will no longer raise an interrupt when passed with state=0;
  * Various string intructions now use SI/DI instead of ESI/EDI when in 16-bit mode;
  * Implemented LOCK and RETF;
  * Fixed a bug in LMSW;
  * Minor disassembler fixes.
- Improved PSX sio [smf].
- Various DIP fixes [Brian Troha]:
  * American Horseshoes & Plotting (taito_l.c);
  * Break Through (brkthru.c);
  * Gold Medalist (alpha68k.c);
  * Got-Ya (gotya.c)
- Phil's 'if I get hit by a bus' Namco S22 MLE update [Phil Stroffolino]:
  - TMS32025:
  * Bugfix for lst and lst1 opcodes; the "ignore ARP" hack has been replaced with a better hack, that doesn't interfere with indirect addressing;
  * Preliminary serial I/O support has been added, to update DRR/DXR on RINT and XINT interrupts.  set_irq_line() no longer masks the lines with 0x7; this allows external triggering of RINT/XINT interrupts.
  - System22 driver changes:
  * Display list processing is now done by the master DSP;
  * The slave DSP's in-game graphics processing and "custom render devices" are currently simulated, which works only for Prop Cycle;
  * Support for PDP block-based memory transfers.
  - Support for DSP data/code uploads from main CPU.
  - Support for "Point RAM" and "Point ROM" access.
  - Most self tests are working in Prop Cycle and Ridge Racer (Japan).
  - Prelim hand-crafted "internal ROMs" for master and slave DSP.
  - Various notes regarding DSP ports/addressing.
