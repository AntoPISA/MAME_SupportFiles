Source changes:
---------------
- Fix SH-2 interpreter [Atari Ace].
- Fix xmcotah/xmcotahr1 ROMs [Razoola].
- Turned i2cmem into a C++ device & ditched the unused legacy device [smf].
- Added per-device image softlist loading routine [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Renamed feof to image_feof (in device_image_interface) in order to compile on FreeBSD [El Barto].
- Removed devtag_get_device(); use machine->device() instead [Aaron Giles].
- Removed the global clock accessors and cpu_* aliases [Aaron Giles]:

  cpu_get_clock == device->unscaled_clock
  cpu_set_clock == device->set_unscaled_clock
  cpu_get_clockscale == device->get_clock_scale 
  cpu_set_clockscale == device->set_clock_scale
  
- Fix bad loop condition that shows up with -cheat enabled [Aaron Giles].
- Adding ability to support other types of software lists, so floppies, cassettes, cd-roms are now possible to be used [Miodrag Milanovic].
- MAMEdev kant spel (Ubuntu/Canonical cares about this) [wallyweek].
- Add *IX man pages for MAME and utils [wallyweek].
- Clean up some files without a newline at the end for GCC [wallyweek].
- Added second button (Hyper Jump) to be used after cued via speech to allow jumping to other phases without finishing the current mission. Volume adjusted to better levels (AY was way too low in comparison to speech) [gravilidavide, Tafoid].
- snowbros.c: Add DIP Switch locations to 'Puzzle King', 'Hyper Pacman', 'Cookie & Bibi 2', 'Cookie & Bibi 3', 'More More'.  Filled in dips with DIP Switch locations for 'Puzzle Break' [Brian Troha].
- Load (but don't yet use) the decapped MCUs for several sets [Dr. Decapitator]:
  * amerdarts;
  * arkanoid (I think the supported MCUs are bootlegs..);
  * blackt96;
  * cshooter;
  * empcity;
  * invasnab (i'm not convinced this one is good);
  * josvolly (there are other chips still need decapping);
  * kyros;
  * kyros (alt, original MCU dump?);
  * officeye (no CPU core for this yet);
  * pasha2;
  * revx;
  * topbladv (no CPU core for this yet);
  * topshoot.
- Added the proms to Magical Odds [Smitdogg, The Dumping Union].
- Converted at28c16 to a C++ device [smf].
- arkanoid.c: Added or corrected the PCB location for the genuine Arkanoid ROM sets and documented the MCU Taito ID number [Brian Troha].
- Replaced the old MCU dump with the decapped version for Kick Start Wheelie King [Dr. Decapitator].
- Replaced the old MCU dump with the decapped version for Pipeline [Dr. Decapitator].
- cb2001: New opcodes [robiza].
- Fixed image unload and creation [Sandro Ronco, Miodrag Milanovic].
- cb2001: Hooked up reels [David Haywood].
- Rewrite of Wheels & Fire driver [Tomasz Slanina]:
  * New rendering code;
  * Preliminary zooming (based on lookup table);
  * Preliminary communication between main and sound CPU;
  * Scanline interrupts and scroll.
- segas16b.c: Removed 2 obsolete "USER2 Work space" and changed remaining USER2 to MCU to maintain consistence throughout the driver [Brian Troha].
- Added information on the Naomi 171-8346C cartridge type [f205v].
- Massive Neo Geo documentation update [Johnboy]:
  * Added official SNK Playmore title catalogue;

  * Identified and tagged all MVS sets which were not officially released for the AES system (according to official SNK Playmore title catalogue and Neo-Geo Masterlist);
  * neodrvr.c cleanup;
  * Renamed (kof99n) to (kof99k) (korean version);
  * Renamed P's in mslug3 to correct chip label, added SMA comment;
  * Renamed ROMs in jockeygp according to original cart, added some comments;
  * Renamed ROMs in vliner/vlinero according to original cart, added some comments;
  * Several sets have been identified (AES/MVS VERSION) and tagged properly;
  * Updated game PCB information
- Fixed some bugs in the MB88xx CPU core [Alex Jackson].
- Various improvements to polepos.c [Alex Jackson]:
  * Corrected the way the steering wheel is hooked up, fixing the jittery steering in the sets with MCUs;
  * Added a new layout file for the bootleg sets without MCUs (topracern and polepos2bi);
  * Converted clock frequencies to crystal values from xtal.c;
  * Added correct ROM names for the Namco-manufactured sets (polepos and polepos2);
  * Completely removed the unused global variable polepos_gear_bit;
  * Fixed a couple of bootleg ROMs that were very likely bit-rotted.
- Added some missing makefile dependencies [Atari Ace].
- Allow the non-DRC RSP core to build again (controlled by a #define like the SH-2 core) [Atari Ace].
- segas16b.c: Corrected the ROM names for the FD1094 317-0120 -'Golden Axe' set and verified the dump as good [Brian Troha].
- lr35902.c: Added the speed register to the register list to allow it to be changed and retrieved again [Sandro Ronco].
