Source changes:
---------------
- Added notes to several drivers indicating specifically that an MCUis needed for decapping [Angelo Salese].
- Naomi renderer: Add all 64 blending modes, and made it anal-retentive where it comes to position precision [Olivier Galibert].
- Converted Irem M14 HW to tilemaps and cleaned-up the driver [Angelo Salese].
- Renamed yumefuda.c/hanaroku.c drivers to albazg.c/albazc.c (like they should be properly named) [Angelo Salese].
- Added MCU no dumps for the Grand Striker driver [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed background colors in Alien Command [Angelo Salese].
- Added profile markers to naomi, to see what % of cpu time things are using [David Haywood].
- Lowered the AY-8910 volumes in the adp driver [Angelo Salese].
- Some Maple fixes, now Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper should be fully playable [Angelo Salese].
- Added cart info documentation update for the two resent Mega-Tech cart dumps: Shadow Dancer & Streets of Rage [Brian Troha].
- Merged memory maps in the following remaining drivers and cleaned up some comments: homedata.c, intrscti.c, inufuku.c, irobot.c, jack.c, kaneko16.c, naughtyb.c, scobra.c, scramble.c, slapfght.c, spaceg.c [MooglyGuy].
- Fixed Naomi bug in computedilated, was causing bad portraits in shikgam2 [David Haywood].
- Removed second parameter from MDRV_CPU_PROGRAM_MAP, MDRV_CPU_DATA_MAP, and MDRV_CPU_IO_MAP. For the remaining drivers that used multiple address maps, converted them to use AM_IMPORT_FROM to import the base map [Aaron Giles].
- Added bilinear filtering to Naomi video emulation. Textures are still a bit crawly since we're always using the lowest MIP level [MooglyGuy, Aaron Giles].
- Short-circuit the naomi rendering in non-textured cases, prevents a lot of bad graphics [David Haywood].
- Fixed tubepb regression [Fabio Priuli].
- Added MC-8123 key for Gigas. Of course the game still doesn't work because the program ROM is missing [Nicola Salmoria].
- Applied some of the Naomi exclusive texture mode rules [David Haywood].
- Added a work-around for the UART FIFO read only status register on the SH-4 to make 'Tetris Kiwamemichi' happy to boot. It crashes shortly after that like 'La Keyboard' though (jumps to an unmapped address) [Angelo Salese].
- Hacked the Naomi YUV interrupt to fire when the base register is written (currently looking at implementing properly, but this prevents KuruCham and SS2005 from hanging) [David Haywood].
- Converted namcos2.c, niyanpai.c and nbmj9195.c to use AM_IMPORT_FROM instead of macros [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed regression for mitchell.c games [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added MCU no-dump to Air Buster [Angelo Salese].
- Commented out the ACIA irq, was causing missing bgms in Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper [Angelo Salese].
- Improved the debugging on the Naomi Wave DMA handler [Angelo Salese].
- Converted DJ Boy memory maps to current standards [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed pipedrm tag problem [Fabio Priuli].
- Fixed ninjakd2 DIPSW and notes [kanikani].
- Fixed a couple of bugs in cave.c and seta2.c introduced with the memory map merges [Fabio Priuli].
- MCS-51 fixes [Aaron Giles]:
  * jb int0,<self> loops are now broken out of if int0 comes and is taken;
  * Externally-clocked counters only count when enabled;
  * Internal RAM no longer wraps when accessed out of bounds.
- System 1 changes [Aaron Giles]:
  * Hooked up 8751 properly;
  * Removed old 8751 hacks.
  * Shuffled Shooting Master sets.
- Fixed tattass regression from map merging [Fabio Priuli]
- Fixed P2 palette write handlers for fromancr and fromanc4 [Fabio Priuli]
- Fixed halleys.c sound: ay8910 write handlers work on two bytes [Fabio Priuli].
- Marked polystar, hellngt and totlvice CHDs as bad. Will be replaced soon [Guru]
- Added missing YMZ280B ROM to evilngt/hellngt [Guru].
- Fixed regression on homedata.c driver [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed Legend of Makai regression [Angelo Salese].
- Removed "BAD_DUMP" from the Red Baron AVG bprom, it has been verified correct (contents and label) by the Dumping Union [Smitdogg].
- Improved the single board 4p mode in Kick N Run / Mexico 86. It basically works but 2p mode is broken so I still keep it as disabled by default [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed Kiki Kai Kai exception [Angelo Salese].
- Dumped io board ROM to Dynamic Golf [Guru].
- Fixed King Derby sprites wrap-around and flip x positioning [Angelo Salese].
