New clone added

Asuka & Asuka (World) [Corrado Tomaselli]


Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed a number of games to explicitly use the SN76489 now that it behaves differently from the SN76496 [Lord Nightmare].
- Fixed inputs in "Ace Attacker" [Barry Gemma].
- Fixed ledutil.c to work for USB keyboards again [ahofle].
- Improved colors in "Safari Rally" [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed stobe light in "Space Encounters" [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Refactored the Dooyong video hardware to take advantage of tilemaps. Also included priority fixes [Vas Crabb].
- Astro Fighter driver update: [Zsolt Vasvari]:
  * Added memory map/interrupt/video timings from schematics;
  * Hooked up SN76477 to "Tomahawk 777";
  * Switched the two Tomahawk 777 sets. The newer version is now the main set and the older has been renamed to (tomahaw1);
  * General driver clean-up.
- Removed unused return value from MACHINE_START and SOUND_START [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Changed save state code to not save any palette information if no palette is used [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Simplified a number of videoram write handlers by removing extraneous dirty checking [Aaron Giles].
- Added support for scaling graphics layouts automatically. The X and Y scale factors are specified in the gfx_decodeinfo structures. Updated the MCR driver to use this feature [Aaron Giles].
- Removed colortables from a number of drivers that didn't need them. Also converted (pacman) and (mappy) drivers to collapse the colortable and palette [Aaron Giles].
- Removed a number of common but useless and/or frequently incorrect comment patterns throughout the code [Aaron Giles].
