0.69u3 2003/06/05 [#129 - David Haywood]
----------------------
Source diff, changed numbering system to ux instead of a,b,c because people were getting confused and thinking mame069b.zip (mame 0.69 _b_inary) was the updated version when it wasn't. Misc fixes and improvements this time, no changes related to the timer system so as far as testing that goes this isn't an essential upgrade. If you use this code in your own build of Mame please make sure you use the correct version number to reflect the inclusion of this updated code.
