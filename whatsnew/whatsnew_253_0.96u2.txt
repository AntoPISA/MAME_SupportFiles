Source changes:
---------------
- Added the ability to specify internal read/write handlers for CPUs so that the new debugger can view internal RAM. Hooked this up for the TMS32025 core [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed window mode 1 in the TMS34010 core, as well as bugs that prevented misaligned stack accesses from working and a bug that didn't force the PC to be 16-bit aligned [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug in MAC instructions in the TMS32025 core. Also fixed cycle counting problems that led to inaccurate internal timers [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed end-of-sprite list and flip screen in Hollywood Action [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed colors in New Sinbad 7 [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Several Taito SJ sprite fixes [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * Fixed sprite priorites. This fixes several priority issues in Tin Star, Elevator Action, High Way Race, and the car wrapping around in Elevator Action at the end of a level;
  * Added sprite clipping at the sides of the screen. This was verified to happen on the real board, and it affects bullets wrapping around in Elevator Action. I'm only 99% sure that the clipping is correct this way :)
  * Fixed sprite hardware collision detection. This fixes the last round in Pirate Pete, bonuses in Alpine Ski, end of level 1 in Water Ski.
- Fixed DIP switches in Rohga [Yasuhiro Ogawa].
- Several Volfied fixes [Bryan McPhail]:
  * Fixed visible area;
  * Fixed ROM names;
  * Improved c-chip simulation - accurate timing and correct colour data for all levels.
- Added the ability to clear an input configure via the delete key [Curt Coder].
- Added cocktail flip support to the Qix driver [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed graphics in Hyper Crash [Pierpaolo Prazzoli, David Haywood].
- Rewrote 8255 PPI mode 2 support, and hooked 8255 to buckrog properly [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed a number of bugs and added support for more SCSI commands and modes [R. Belmont, Ville Linde].
- Hooked up MSM5205 to Goal! '92 and to Euro League (bootleg), but it doesn't sound too good yet [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Cleaned up the decryption in the Epos games [Nicola Salmoria].
- Changed xday2 to use default namcona1 joystick inputs. With those, if you wait the initial test to finish, you can play it [Sonikos].
- Fixed L button in mj4simai which was missing [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added support for Single monitor Playchoice 10 BIOS. Since the core doesn't allow you to change aspect ratio or remove dual monitor flag at run-time, the game always runs in the upper part of the screen [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added a -debugscript command line parameter that invokes a debugger script on startup [Nathan Woods].
- Modified the MIPS DRC core to disable optimizations when mame_debug is on. This makes it easier to run comparative traces when running both with and without MIPS DRC enabled [Nathan Woods].
- Simplified the decryption code in the sun8 driver, and made some improvements to the Brick Zone main set [Nicola Salmoria].
- Patched the non-DRC PPC core to compile properly when not all PPC cores (403, 602, 603) are enabled. Implemented fcmpo instruction [Nathan Woods].
- Swapped On Screen Display and Config Menu items so that accidental key configuration changes don't kill your ability to get to the menu by default [Aaron Giles].
