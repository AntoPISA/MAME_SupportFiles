- Change to consistently use Intel notation for hex values in TMS32010 disassembler, rather than a mix of Motorola and Intel notation. [Lord Nightmare].
- Z80: Check for NOP in interrupt mode 0. This allows code like ei / halt / di to work correctly. A better solution would be to implement full support for arbitrary opcodes in mode 0 [Dirk Best].
- igs017.c update [Luca Elia]:
  * Merged in some IGS031 based games (igs_m68.c, tarzan.c);
  * Implemented tiles flip x and video disable;

- Almost complete decryption of (starzan) and (tarzana) [iq_132].
- Documented presence of Namco customs on the Pole Position bootleg (Top Racer) sets. Removed Namco devices from bootlegs which don't have them [David Haywood].
- Added save state support to plygonet.c and the DSP56156 CPU core [Andrew Gardner].
- Updated SN76489/A to have correct PRNG waveforms (a 0 bit was missing at the beginning, and beginning of SN76489 waveform was all 1s instead of 0s as measured on hardware). Added SN94624 (same as SN76489) [Lord Nightmare, plgDavid (David Viens)].
- IGS blitter based games update [Luca Elia]:
  * Renamed driver to igs011.c and cleaned it up;

  * Implemented hopper in (lhb), (lhb2) and (wlcc);
  * Decrypted (ryukobou).
- i386 core fixes [Barry Rodewald]:
  * Added Nested Task flag, and I/O Privilege flags. They aren't implemented in any way, but can now be set or reset. Can be used to detect a 80386 or later CPU;
  * Implemented ENTER instruction;
  * Made IRQ vectors treated as 8 bytes when in protected mode, and made the addresses pushed onto the stack 32-bit if the gate descriptor used is a 386 interrupt or trap gate (also when in protected mode, will always be 16-bit if in real mode).
- Fixes to default mapping as well as comment/information fixes for "Mole Attack" [MASH/Tafoid].
- Identify puyoj set as Rev B and correct various ROM names [Smitdogg, Dumping Union].
- Improved Super Nova sprite shrinking, used by "Gals Panic S2" and "Sengeki Striker" [David Haywood].

  * Added the alt tilemap layout used by (f1superb) for the backgrounds;
  * Added (f1superb) notes and IRQ generation code from (nuapete).

  * Set (toursol) date to 1995;
  * Set (toursol) CPU speed to 40MHz.
- Many improvements to konamigx rendering, specifically improving "Soccer Superstars" and "Rushing Hero" [David Haywood, Angelo Salese].
- Implemented input buffer copy protection in "Rushing Heroes", game is now somewhat playable with heavy GFX glitches [Angelo Salese].

  * Improved disassembly of PMMU instructions;
  * Preliminary 68LC040 support;
  * Fixed disassembly for EC/LC variants of '030/'040.
- Patched NVRAM check in Jackpot Cards, makes the game playable but you cannot save settings so it's not yet working [Angelo Salese].
- Trashed the old pre-accurate-clocking STEP based sample averaging scheme from sn76489 and friends, vastly simplifying the code. Made the output bipolar rather than only above the 0 line. Added missing statement to the get_safe_token function for the recently added SN94624 [Lord Nightmare].
- Many N64 RDP fixes [angrylion, Ziggy, Gonetz, Orkin, DrgnMndd, Harmony].
- Cleaned up toaplan2 V25 support, enabled Batsugun V25 and added decryption table info for the other games [David Haywood].
- Improved the V25S memory map in Batsugun, now CPUs starts to communicate properly, needs to find & implement the irq that clears the RAM flag and decrypt the relative opcodes in that [Angelo Salese].
