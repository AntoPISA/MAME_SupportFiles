Source changes:
---------------------
- Fixed sound in Desert Breaker with new roms [Aaron Giles, Gerald, Thierry].
- Fixed dip-switches to nmk16 driver [Brian Troha].
- New Discrete Sound Functionality [Derrick Renaud, Frank Palazzolo]
  * DISCRETE_OP_AMP_FILTER - properly emulated DISC_OP_AMP_FILTER_IS_BAND_PASS_1M type filter. Used by many games. See: http://home.cogeco.ca/~derrickmame/galaga/Galaga_filters.html
  * atafifb, abaseb - Re-wrote to use component value only code and use new filter.
- Fixed crash in i8x41 cpu core reading uninitialized internal RAM [Juergen Buchmueller].
- Super Qix driver update [Nicola Salmoria]
  * Manually repaired the ROM code and added support for the I8751 MCU, so the two original sets work.
  * Swapped sqix and sqixa, because the the former was dumped from a bootleg board (though there's no reason to believe the ROMs were modified, so I didn't mark it as bootleg).
  * Merged with pbillian.
  * Fixed pbillian/hotsmash sample playback.
  * Fixed pbillian MCU simulation and inputs.
  * Improved hotsmash MCU simulation, the game is playable now though still incomplete.
- Bubble Bobble driver update [Nicola Salmoria]
  * Removed the 68705 CPU emulation, since that's not what the original used.
  * Simulated the 68701 MCU.
  * Enemy movement should now be correct (bublbobl36rc2yel).
  * Fixed clock item behaviour. Now enemies start moving again after 10 seconds (bublbobl36b3yel).
  * Supported coin lockout.
  * Emulated the boblbobl protection device, getting rid of the ROM patches.
  * Adjusted PSG volume in tokio (tokiob067gre).
- Fixed gaplus driver to use its samples [Brian Troha].
- Fixes the undocumented bit test opcodes in hd6309 cpu core [Nathan Woods].
- Some i386 cpu core fixes [Nathan Woods]
  * Fixed algorithm for identifying 32-bit segments.
  * Near branches now won't force a segment reload.
  * Implemented RET imm16 under 16-bit mode.
  * Fixed SBB instruction (the borrow was deducted from the second operand, not the result).
  * Fixed LDS, LSS, LES, LFS, LGS under 32-bit mode.
  * Partially implemented LLDT, LTR, CLTS, WAIT and MOV dr instructions.
- Some C89 compilers fixes [Lawrence Gold]
- Renamed arcadia machine/vidhrdw/include files from arcadia.* to amiga.* [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed Vs. Stroke & Match Golf name [chaneman].
- Fixed oisipuzl inputs [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed Rainbow Islands visible area [Nicola Salmoria].
- ST-V fixes [Angelo Salese]
  * Fixed various DMA bugs, including a missing save/update mode in indirect mode and added a default add value for the A-Bus transfer, to avoid strange uploads.
  * Further improved the SCU emulation, added two unemulated irqs (PAD and SCSP), improved the "illegal" DMA operations and started to work out with the games headers.
- Fixed a disassembler bug with the Nec cpu core [Angelo Salese]
- Fixed player 2 and 3 inputs in xenophob [Hans Andersson].
- Fixed sound banking in taito_f3 driver [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed memory leaking and added a check in debug builds [Nicola Salmoria].
- Hyperstone cpu core fixes
  * Added and fixed the timer and removed the hack [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
  * Fixed delayed branching for delay instructions longer than 2 bytes [Tomasz Slanina].
- Fixed colors and Cocktail support in Enigma 2 [chaneman, Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added SE3208 cpu core emulation [ElSemi].
- Fixed model1 driver compiling problem with OpenVMS [Robert Alan Byer].
- Fixed itech32 driver crash on AMD64 cpus [R. Belmont].
- Fixed namco54 sound driver compiling in VisualC++ [Kenneth Miller].
