Source changes:
---------------
- Added a DMA kludge to get Derby Quiz My Dream Horse to boot [R. Belmont].
- Added the ability to tweak the refresh rate if -cheat is enabled. Use SHIFT to modify by 0.1fps, CONTROL to modify by 0.01fps, and ALT to modify by 0.001fps [Aaron Giles].
- Changed the "driver.status" entry in -listxml to summarize all the status entries allowing frontends to completely ignore all the other flags [Andrea Mazzoleni].
- Cleaned up and reorganized the DCS sound module. This required changing the way ROMs are loaded for all of the DCS-using games [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed crash in the MIPS core introduced with the u2 changes [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed graphics crashing, palette, sprites, and some networking registers in Final Lap [R. Belmont].
- Fixed save states in the m62 and mnight drivers [Andrew Gardner].
- Fixed the generic_fopen() function to ensure that a ROM CRC is present before using it. Otherwise, for NO_DUMP roms an uninitialized string variable is used in the search [Andrea Mazzoleni].
- Fixed the PSX SIO timer so that it only fires when there is data to send & processes one bit per tick [smf].
- Major rewrite of the Portraits driver [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]:
  * Fixed scrolling.
  * Fixed screen resolution.
  * Added NVRAM.
  * Added fake photo when you get the best score.
  * Fixed service switches and coins.
  * Added missing roms and the 2nd set.
- Several Seibu SPI fixes [Ville Linde]:
  * Removed all remaining sound hacks.
  * Added some missing i386 opcodes.
  * Added support for external read/write handlers to the YMF271  (required for SPI flash ROM updating mode).
  * Hooked up flash ROMs via the new YMF271 support. 
  * Fixed various crash bugs in rf2_us, rf2_2k, and rf2_eur.
