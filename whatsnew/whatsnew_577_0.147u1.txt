Source changes:
---------------
- 6532riot.c: Internal timer is always running. Fixes several a2600 regressions [Wilbert Pol].
- Added generic set of pinball mechanical sounds [Robbbert].
- Added irq ack to Shanghai 3 HW [Angelo Salese].
- Added -verifysoftware command [Wilbert Pol].
- aftor: Fixed display, marked as WORKING [Robbbert].
- Better simulation of 'Metal Slug X's' protection device [IQ_132].
- Changed CPS-1 video timings to SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS [Angelo Salese].
- Emulated 'Lord of Gun's' protection rather than patching it out [iq_132].
- Fix for "file note writeable" when creating, plus consolidated some duplicate/redundant code [smf].
- Fixed M68K and hooked up SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS for Blocken. Game was definitely running at erratic speeds before [Angelo Salese, Tafoid].
- gunpey.c - Corrected OKI M6925 frequency [Phil Bennett].
- Implemented DS75160A/DS75161A IEEE-488 GPIB Transceivers [Curt Coder].
- In e.g. rranger [Luca Elia].
- lib7z: Fix portability problems that resulted in memory trashing in some configurations [R. Belmont].
- m6509: Fixed EA zero page indirect + Y (post indexed) [Curt Coder].
- Made Epson R4543 RTC a proper RTC device, eliminates duplicated code in Namco Systems 12 and 23 [R. Belmont].
- mcr68.c: Add dipswitch locations to all sets in the driver [Brian Troha].
- Memory handler cleanup 3. Add mem_mask parameter to 8-bit handlers to match the others. To ease pain, added DECLARE_READ/WRITE_HANDLER macros that set up a default parameter. Also updated devcb so that the handlers can be called with or without the mem_mask [Aaron Giles].
- Memory handler normalization, part 1. READ/WRITE_DEVICE*_HANDLERs are now passed an address_space & and the 8-bit variants get a mem_mask as well. This means they are now directly compatible with the member function delegates. Added a generic address space to the driver_device that can be used when no specific address space is available. Also added DECLARE_READ/WRITE_DEVICE*_HANDLER macros to declare device callbacks with default mem_mask parameters [Aaron Giles].
- Memory handler normalization, part 2. Change legacy read/write handlers to take an address_space & instead of an address_space *. Also update pretty much all other functions to take a reference where appropriate [Aaron Giles].
- mos6526: Implemented a nearly cycle-exact "old" CIA, which passes most of the Lorenz/VICE CIA tests. Refactored the c64/c128/vic10/cbm2 drivers and the 1571/1581 floppy drives to use the new implementation [Curt Coder].
- Moved scsi protocol code from scsibus_device to scsihle_device, leaving scsibus_device to calculate the current bus contents and distribute it to each of the scsidev_device [smf].
- mt03464: Fixed potential out of array access in src/emu/video/voodoo.c logerror() [Oliver Stöneberg].
- Ported Palette brightness effects to 'Raiden 2' HW, used by 'Zero Team' and 'X Se Dae' [Angelo Salese].
- Promoted starfigh to playable state [Luca Elia]:
  * Address line scrambling of data ROMs.
  * ROM bank latching and mirroring.
  * Sound latch and NMI disable.
  * Patched some further protection.
  * Added graphics banking.
- Rotation: Added motor simulation; added nvram; added mechanical sounds; added notes [Robbbert].
- Seibu COP: Added 0x1c param to 0x0205 command, fixes at least sprite positioning during intros of 'Raiden 2' and 'Zero Team' (but breaks gameplay in 'Zero Team', needs investigation) [Angelo Salese, Smitdogg].
- Seibu COP: Added 0xe38e command, used by Seibu Cup Soccer to follow the ball [Angelo Salese].
- Seibu COP: Made 0x42c2 command more accurate, makes 'Legionnaire' enemies to behave properly and match finally starts in 'Seibu Cup Soccer' [Angelo Salese, Smitdogg].
- Since nobody checks for NULLs anyway, make device_memory_interface::space() assert against NULL and return a reference, and pushed references throughout all address space usage in the system. Added a has_space() method to check for those rare case when it is ambiguous [Aaron Giles].
- spectra: Added remaining sounds, game marked as WORKING [Robbbert].
- suna8.c: Fixed sound samples width, improves speech
- tms99x8: Converted to using RGB32 bitmap so chips can coexist with other video screens [R. Belmont].
