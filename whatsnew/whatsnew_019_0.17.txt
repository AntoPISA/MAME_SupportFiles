Program changes
---------------
- Submitted a massive contribution: an 8086 CPU emulator, and drivers for Q*Bert and Mad Planets. They run quite slowly on my 486/100 (~25 fps) but are playable. Q*Bert has sound too (with samples) [Fabrice Frances].
- Various fixes to Green Beret: it now has 100% accurate colors. DIP switches didn't work, fixed. Support for Rush'n Attack (the US version). I've been told that it actually was too fast, so now it runs slower. Let me know how accurate it is [Paul Swan].
