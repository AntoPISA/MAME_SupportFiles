Source changes:
---------------
- Replaced TMS5200 table with table extracted using PROMOUT from actual chip. monymony sounds much better [Lord Nightmare].
- Improvements to Treasure Bonus (Subsino) [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Reworked and cleaned-up the inputs. Most buttons have more than one single function;
  * Added DIP locations;
  * Figured out the following DIP switches: Complete Coinage (1/2/5/10/20/25/50/100). Remote Credits (1/2/5/10/20/25/50/100). Minimum Bet (1/8/16/32). Max Bet (16/32/64/80). Demo Sounds (Off/On). Game Limit (10000/20000/30000/60000). Double-Up (No/Yes). Win Rate (84/86/88/90/92/94/96%). Double-Up Level (0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7). Double-Up Game (Dancers / Panties Colors / Cards / Seven-Bingo);
  * Fixed inverted functions and buggy inputs;
  * Added lamps support;
  * Created button-lamps layout;
  * Remapped inputs to reflect the controls layout. This way is more user-friendly since controls are straight with button-lamps;
  * Added coin/keyin/keyout/payout counters;
  * Removed the pulse limitation in the BET input. This allow it to work as BET and STOP2 properly;
  * Added technical notes.
  - Status Fun Casino improvements [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Reworked inputs to match the standard;
  * Lowered the CPU clock to get it working properly;
  * Added technical notes.
- Output Cleanup/Hookup (Part 2) [Howard Casto]:
  * segas32.c: Hooked up all digital outputs for all games (radm, alien3, radr, f1en, arescue, f1lap, jpark, slipstrm, orunners, harddunk, scross, titlef) Emulation needs to progress more on the analog output data before those outputs can be hooked up.
  * audio\mw8080bw.c: Changed output name for desertgn to something more descriptive (Player1_Gun_Recoil).
  * bbusters.c: Added new output handling functions and hooked up outputs for (bbusters) and (mechatt).
  * opwolf3.c: Added gun outputs for opwolf3 (man that game is terrible).
  * machine\williams.c: Fixed existing outputs in tshoot (they needed inverted) and hooked up the rest, including the feather blower :-D
  * gunbustr.c: Hooked up all outputs for (gunbstr).
  * namcos12.c: Hooked up outputs for all system 11 gun games (ptblank2, ghlpanic, tenkomor)
  * segaybd.c: Hooked up all digital outputs (gloc, glocr360, gforce2, pdrift, rchase, strkfghtr), also hooked up motor/analog outputs for Power Drift and G-Loc/ Strike Fighter The remaining games with motors could be hooked up as well assuming emulation can progress enough to get past the error messages.
  * namcos2.c: Hooked up gun recoils for golly ghost. Also noted that the outputs for the remaining gun games are also in that area. Someone who can find the offsets should be able to hook them up.
  * segas18.c: Hooked up gun recoils for (lghost).
  * taito_z.c: Hooked up outputs for (spacegun) and made a few prototype functions to help in hooking up the remaining games. Someone familiar with the driver should take a look. I hooked up a few, but they don't work like they should according to the comments.
- toutrun.c: Corrected DIP switches in the most recently added Turbo Out Run set, and reorganized the sets so that the parent is the FD1094 317-0118 set, the "newest" set based on both EPROM and security chip part numbers [Andrew Jackson].
- Fix two VS2008 warnings (namcos23.c and rdpfb.c) [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Remove some stray invalid code in start_profiler() [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Have srcclean add missing newlines to end of .c files [Atari Ace].
- Fix the memory leaks with the strconv.c function by using osd_malloc() instead. Fixed other memory leaks as well [Oliver Stoneberg].
- "Replaced" TMS5220 table with table extracted using PROMOUT from actual chip. By 'Replaced', I mean documented, as the actual extracted table exactly matched the table already in MAME. Changed TMS5220C to use the same energy table as 5220 does, since my previous assumption based on the Quadravox tables was probably wrong. Updated the ranout condition code of tms5220.c to be slightly more accurate to the chip, and added TODOs. Re-enabled the timers for deactivating the READY line on /WS or /RS as this is probably slightly more accurate to hardware, but the difference is 2 or 3 clock cycles max [Lord Nightmare].
- Fixed linking of chdman.exe and romcmp.exe with Visual Studio [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Fixed incorrect DSK ROM size, shuffled around some ROM mapping, added new ROMs that were incorrectly assumed to be identical to than racedriv. The previously bad ROM checksums are now correct. Now the watchdog resets it instead of getting an address error [Luigi30].
- Added a screen layout for Space Stranger based on photos [MASH].
- Added redumped sound ROM to Vs. Net Soccer (vsnetscr) [Team Japump].
- Disable many unused variables as identifed by cppcheck [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Naomi: Added rounding to the GD-ROM DMA transfers, will be need for Virtua Tennis to make it boot [Deunan Knute, Angelo Salese].
  - AICA updates [PluginNinja]:
  * Implemented slot monitor;
  * Improved ADPCM looping;
  * General cleanup.
  - SCSP updates [PluginNinja]:
  * Improved slot monitor function;
  * Various cleanups.
- namcos23: Varied stuff, isolate PIO, pcb test works on timecrs2c [Olivier Galibert].
- namcos23: Quick hack to make 500gp boot [Olivier Galibert].
- namcos23: Increase the main RAM size so that crszone goes into POST [Olivier Galibert].
- Implemented Sort-DMA IRQ firing [Angelo Salese].
- Naomi: Implemented Wave DMA HW trigger and added Wave DMA IRQ firing [Angelo Salese].
- Naomi: Implemented PVR-DMA HW trigger [Angelo Salese].
- Fix compile error when DEBUG_GENERATION is defined [Oliver Stoneberg].
- cdrom: Correct header length for form 2 raw sectors [R. Belmont].
- namcos23: Mirror, mirror v2 [A. Giles, Olivier Galibert].
- Naomi: Implemented mahjong panel support [Angelo Salese].
- TMS5220: Made /READY timing accurate to the real chip as best as possible. Note that on the zaccaria games, possibly due to a bug in the CA2 line handler of the PIA which reads the /READY state, speech usually won't work until midway through the first game played, but works fine afterward. Not sure if that's a MAME bug or an original game bug [Lord Nightmare].
- Replaced the DEBUG_FRAME_DUMP define with a new DEBUG_PARSE_FRAME_DUMP which produces binary listings of each frame parsed [Lord Nightmare].
- Added newer Area51: Site 4 BIOS [Guru].
- Sega system16 and later: First pass in the conversion of video ICs to be devices [David Haywood].
- Fix swapped stereo in gauntlet and gauntlet 2. Thor (warrior)'s/red player's coin slot is toward the left, and specific sounds for that player (coin insert gong, death ditty, etc) should come from the left speaker, not the right. Verified with schematics. TODO: merge gauntlet audio into atarijsa.c since the gauntlet audio hardware is clearly the direct ancestor of the Atari JSA-i audio board, and currently is missing most of the chip specific volume controls, etc which are already implemented in atarijsa.c [Lord Nightmare].
- Improved Killing Blade encrypted DMA mode 3 [XingXing, David Haywood].
- vrender0.c: Converted to be a device [Fabio Priuli].
- crystal.c: Added driver data class [Fabio Priuli].
- Improved DMA modes 1+2 in killbld, allowing all DMA operations used by the game to work and the RAM dump to be removed [XingXing, David Haywood].
- Added save states to the following CPU: apexc, asap, avr8, cp1610, dsp32 and f8 [Fabio Priuli].
- Documentation improvements to the Sega Naomi HW games [f205v].
- Added a protection RAM dump for Dragon World 3 [XingXing].
- Added a delay to the GDROM DMA transfers, allows KOF Neowave to boot [Angelo Salese].
- Redumped one program ROM in Killing Blade [XingXing, David Haywood].
- Hook up the ym2151 reset bit to the sound cpu in gauntlet, and fixed sound reset to properly reset all the sound chips and volume latches [Lord Nightmare].
- Fix race condition involving tms52xx status register which broke victory/victorba self test. Updated debug routines a bit, and improved the non-NORMALMODE a bit [Lord Nightmare].
- Improvements to Pachifever driver [Tomasz Slanina, maruwa]:
  * Replaced ic48.50 ROM with correct dump;
  * Added correct MSM clock value;
  * Added second SN76489A chip (used for SFX);
  * Updated HW notes.
- Cleaned up ranout (FIFO running out mid-frame) to be accurate to hardware; Cleaned up talk status clearing to be more accurate to hardware; Cleaned up parse_frame function significantly. Added some more comments [Lord Nightmare].
- aristmk4: Hooked up the two AY8910s [Fr45h3r].
- snes_snd: Fix Linux 64-bit compile issues [R. Belmont].
- Naomi: Improved the YUV FIFO IRQ firing, now it should be possible to emulate the YUV decoding properly [Angelo Salese].
- PGM: Added support for newer bios ROM [XingXing].
- Corrected mask ROM numbers for HOTD2 [f205v].
- Fix ZPAR (zeroed k parameters 5-10) behavior for unvoiced frames. Updated comments and debug functions [Lord Nightmare].
- Naomi: Work-around for an int32 overflow bug in the renderer, makes The House of the Dead 2 / The Typing of the Dead to not crash during attract mode [Angelo Salese].
- Naomi: Improved Vblank-In irq timings [Angelo Salese].
- Redid parameter interpolation and frame load logic so new frames don't immediately force all the Energy/Pitch/K values to the values of the old frame, but wait until their first interpolation to do so. This fix improves speech quality considerably [Lord Nightmare].
- Naomi: implemented RTC start-up values [Angelo Salese].
- astrocorp.c: Added PCB layout and board information for the Skill Drop Georgia set [Brian Troha].
