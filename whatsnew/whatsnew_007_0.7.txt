Program:
--------
- Support for:
  Amidar US version
  Crazy Climber Japanese version
  Phoenix/Pleiades (no sound)
  Pooyan (wrong colors, no sound)
  Super Cobra (version running on a modified Scramble board)
- Scramble has 100% correct colors. The same palette is used by Super Cobra, but it doesn't look right.
- Gorf and Robby Roto boot but don't work.
- Added some support for Moon Quasar, but it doesn't work. Since the ROMs are encrypted, I don't know if this is due to wrong decryption, bad ROM, or wrong driver (I'm using the Moon Cresta one). I think that either MQ3 (which maps at 1000-17ff) is bad, or it uses a different encryption.
