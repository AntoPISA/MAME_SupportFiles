Program changes:
----------------
- Support for [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * Amidar US version;
  * Crazy Climber Japanese version;
  * Phoenix/Pleiades (no sound);
  * Pooyan (wrong colors, no sound);
  * Super Cobra (version running on a modified Scramble board).
- Scramble has 100% correct colors. The same palette is used by Super Cobra, but it doesn't look right [Nicola Salmoria].
- Gorf and Robby Roto boot but don't work [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added some support for Moon Quasar, but it doesn't work. Since the ROMs are encrypted, I don't know if this is due to wrong decryption, bad ROM, or wrong driver (I'm using the Moon Cresta one). I think that either MQ3 (which maps at 1000-17ff) is bad, or it uses a different encryption [Nicola Salmoria].
