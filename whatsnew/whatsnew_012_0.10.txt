0.10 1997/03/13 [#012 - Nicola Salmoria]
----------------------------------------
[NOTE: Only important changes are listed]


New games supported:
--------------------
(centiped) Centipede [Nicola Salmoria]
(congo)    Congo Bongo (Rev C, 2 board stack) [Ville Laitinen]
(nibbler)  Nibbler [Nicola Salmoria]


Program:
--------
- Centipede support. This is the first 6502 game supported by MAME. I'm currently using Marat Fayzullin's engine [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed a small graphics glitch in the background of Bomb Jack's third level. Thanks to Philip Chapman for the report [Nicola Salmoria].
- I had also broken Pleiades, fixed. That's the drawback of emulating more than 60 games, I can't check them all before releasing a new version ;-) [Nicola Salmoria].
- I received no less than three different palettes for Donkey Kong Jr., from Brad Oliver, Marc Vergoossen and Richard Davies. The one included is from Marc [Nicola Salmoria].
- Nibbler support. This is the second 6502 game supported by MAME ;-) Interesting hardware: no sprites, two playfields, and it uses RAM for character generation (redefining the characters to animate the worm) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Thanks to Gary Walton and Simon Walls, we now have 100% accurate colors in Crush Roller and Uniwars/Japirem. Moon Cresta and Moon Quasar might be correct as well, but I'm not sure [Nicola Salmoria].
- Thanks to Valerio Verrando, now -noscanlines works on Pac Man and the other games using a 224x288 screen. If you have problems with the default video mode try this one, it will hopefully solve them [Nicola Salmoria].
- Ville Laitinen provided a Congo Bongo driver! The colors are terrible ;-), but it's playable.


Source changes:
---------------
- Support for 6502 CPU. From a driver writer point of view, it is used just like the Z80, the only difference being that you have to specify CPU_M6502 instead of CPU_Z80 in the MachineDriver definition. Multiple CPUs are still NOT supported mirror [Nicola Salmoria].
- New function in common.c: decodechar(). It was originally part of decodegfx(), and is used to convert one single char from the machine format to the one used by the emulator. This function was needed by the Nibbler driver to dynamically convert the graphics at runtime [Nicola Salmoria].
