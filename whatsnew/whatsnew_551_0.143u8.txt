Source changes:
---------------
- Improvements to magicfly.c [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Confirmed and fixed CPU clock for magicfly and 7mezzo.
  * Rearranged the graphic ROMs addressing. Splitted both gfx banks.
  * Created and minimized the color palette for both gfx banks.
  * Fixed colors for magicfly and 7mezzo.
- Provided DVD dump for junai [alien_mame, The Dumping Union].
- lethalen: Improved offset screen and gun in japan version; removed EEPROM default values [Roberto Zandon√†].
- taito_z.c: Added PCB locations to the Aqua Jack sets [ShouTime].

- Wrote a basic core for Epson RTC-9701 device chip [David Haywood, Angelo Salese].
- Fixed various translitteration errors in csplayh5.c game name descriptions [Fujix].

- Removed deprecat.h usage from higemaru.c and srmp6.c [Angelo Salese].
- naomi: Fix various crashes for some GD-ROM sets [R. Belmont].
- Added tables from vlm5030 as verified by decap from ogoun. Adapted vlm5030 to use the tms5xxx common tables file. Some details have yet to be worked out for certain (how exactly the reflection coefficients beyond k=2 address the k2+ rom) [ogoun, Lord Nightmare, The Dumping Union].
- Adjusted the VLM5030 K3 thru K10 coefficients to be based not on reading the K2 ROM but based on the index itself <<6 or 7. This makes the games sound much better and explains the very small RAM size used for coefficients other than K1 and K2. This needs further investigation and figuring out of the die schematic to settle completely [Lord Nightmare].
- Various gottlieb.c fixes [Tafoid]:
  * Verified through playtesting, manuals and in-game service modes all DIPs in the driver. Consolidated and added DIP Locations based on all available information.
  * Changed Q*bert and Q*bert's Qubes joystick layout to 8-Way to allow for diagonals to be not only be mapped but used if desired.
