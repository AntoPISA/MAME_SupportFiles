Source changes:
---------------
- Corrected clock speeds for the megasys1.c boards. Yes, the games actually ran _THAT_ slow! [Brian Troha].
- Makefile & build system update [Couriersud]:
  * verinfo: New syntax. verinfo now uses the following syntax: verinfo.exe -b windows|winui|mess. Does not depend on compile time defines any longer;
  * Makefile will include src/osd/$(CROSS_BUILD_OSD)/build.mak if it exists. This was necessary to enable cross builds for winui.
- Cloak & Dagger video code cleanup [Zsolt Vasvari]:
  * resnet conversion - colors are now signficantly less saturated because of the 1K pull-ups. This is noticable in the agent's coat and the sky color, for example;
  * Added bitmap palette selection based on the 128H line. Not sure where this is actually used in the game.
- Removed unnecessary machine->pens[] lookups in a large number of drivers [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Added built-in layout to Space Tactics. Cleaned up and reorganized the driver [Mr. Do!, Zsolt Vasvari].
- Switched the funworld color decoding routines to use resnet code [Roberto Fresca].
- Fixed namcos2, namcos21 crashes due to NVRAM allocation in MACHINE_RESET. Created MACHINE_START and move allocation there [Couriersud].
- Updated info.c to output raw video parameters (pixclock, htotal, hbend, hbstart, vtotal, vbend, vbstart) via -listxml if they have been given [Couriersud].
- Removed some deprecat.h includes from osd layer [Couriersud]:
  * Add machine as parameter to osd_update and osd_update_audio_stream;
  * Change Machine to machine and remove include deprecat.h.
- Added a rule in vconv.c to make VS2008 compile seamlessly [Aaron Giles].
- bionicc.c [Couriersud]:
  * Added cpu clocks from schematics;
  * Comment about z80 nmi generation.
- Fixed the DAC sound in X The Ball. [Zsolt Vasvari, Mamesick].
- Removed the confirmed bad dump of 'Virtua striker 2 2000' [Brian Troha].
- Fixes crash in Raiga [Zsolt Vasvari, David Haywood].
- drawgfx.c improvments [Zsolt Vasvari]:
  * Added some asserts to drawgfx and drawgfxzoom;
  * Moved some variable declarations so that they are only visible where they are actually used.
- Removed 8bpp bitmap support from drawgfx [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Removed MDRV_PALETTE_LENGTH from vector games, which would trigger an assert in emupal.c (debug build) [Couriersud].
- Added new module: tokenize.h. This centralizes the behavior of tokenizing data structures, as currently used by the input port system. Redid the input port tokenization to be more compact and make use of the new macros. Added support for designated initializers in C99 and GCC builds to enforce type safety [Aaron Giles].
- Removed bogus DIPs from the NSS driver [R. Belmont].
- Improved the global "flip_screen" macros and variables [Couriersud]:
  * Fix issues related to flip_screen being a define;
  * Add "int flip_screen_get(void)";
  * Clean up drivers with collisions ;
  * Remove flip_screen macro;
  * Flip_screen_x and flip_screen_y made static;
  * Add flip_screen_x_get() and flip_screen_y_get();
  * Change writes to flip_screen_x to flip_screen_set_no_update();
  * Added save state calls for flip_screen_x and flip_screen_y.
- Converted MACHINE_DRIVER definitions from function constructors to tokenized lists. For the most part this is a non-invasive change, except for those drivers using MDRV_WATCHDOG_TIME_INIT. In order to allow for tokenization of attotimes, a set of new macros is provided called UINT64_ATTOTIME_IN_x() which follows the same pattern as ATTOTIME_IN_x() but packs the attotime down into a single 64-bit value for easier tokenization. Fixed several errors in the machine drivers which were caught by the additional checks now done in the machine config detokenization code [Aaron Giles].
- Separated MDRV_DEVICE_CONFIG_DATA into 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Added floating-point versions with configurable resolutions [Aaron Giles].
- Converted speakers into devices. Machine->config no longer houses an array of speakers; instead they are iterated through using the new macros (defined in sound.h) speaker_output_first() and speaker_output_next(). Updated all relevant code to do this [Aaron Giles].
- Added typedefs for all the machine config callback functions at the top of driver [Aaron Giles].
- Big changes to Cal Omega driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Renamed the driver to calomega.c;
  * Extended the driver to support all the other Cal Omega systems;
  * Switched to XTAL def;
  * Fixed CPU & sound clocks based on official diagrams;
  * Replaced the AY-8910 with AY-8912 to match the real hardware;
  * Unified some memory maps;
  * Splitted machine in sys903 and sys905;
  * Fixed memory map offsets for sys905;
  * Added a list of official/unofficial games, and their states;
  * Fixed a bug introduced when extended the color PROM region to  eliminate colortable length;
  * Updated technical notes.
- Merged memory maps for a number of drivers beginning with a digit or the letter 'a' [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned up the Crazy Climber video driver, mainly via tilemap conversion. This fixes the ape sprite positioning in Crazy Kong - no more gap between feet and platform. Merged Yamato driver with Crazy Climber [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Converted XX Mission to tilemaps [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Removed VIDEO_START(generic) - no longer used [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Added PGM.c EEPROM/hiscore saving [Creamymami].
- Added support for original Omega Race state PROM. [Mathis Rosenhauer].
- Added support in the MC6845 emulation for cursors. All 4 blinking modes are supported [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Added a stub implementation of the Rockwell 6545 [Nathan Woods].
- Added basic support for the NEC uPD7801, uPD78C05, and uPD78C06 CPUs to the uPD7810 cpu core [Wilbert Pol].
- Some improvements to the 6850 ACIA CTS pin checking logic and the MPU4 ACIA clock logic [James Wallace].
- Another Risky Challenge opcode to fix a sprite bug and a general clean up of the remarks in the driver [robiza].
- Added dip locations to astinvad, bonzeadv, cadash, asuka, mofflott, galmedes, atarifb, atarifb4, abaseb, soccer. Added DIP locations and improved DIP switches in seawolf2, wow, gorf, robby, profpac [RansAckeR].
- One-line fix for the z80pio. At the moment when the interrupt control word is sent (with interrupts enabled), an interrupt occurs. In reality, interrupts are disabled until the interrupt mask byte is sent [Robbbert].
