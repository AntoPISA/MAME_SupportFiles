These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Added the missing background layer to Cobra Command [Bryan McPhail].
- Char/sprite priority in Lode Runner 2 & 3 and in Battle Road [Eric Hustvedt].
- Colors & sprites in Super Real Darwin should be correct [Bryan McPhail].

Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- Fixed controls in Gondomania and Last Mission [Bryan McPhail].
- Fixed the in game timer in Captain Silver, this probably fixes other gameplay glitches [Bryan McPhail].

Changes to the main program:
----------------------------
- New switch "-waitvsync /-nowaitvsync" (use it with -novsync); it waits for video sync before drawing the screen but uses the normal MAME throttling. This gives smoother display with scrolling game (like vsync), but works with video modes with higher refresh frequency, and is more win-friendly [Valerio Verrando].

Source changes:
---------------
- Major overhaul to the cpu cores. Note that the debugger doesn't work in this release [Juergen Buchmueller].
