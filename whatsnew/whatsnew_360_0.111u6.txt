Source changes:
--------------
- Added mappings for break and pause keys [Dirk Best].
- Added preliminary support for the built-in effects DSP in the SCSP which lots of games use for reverb, QSound, and other effects. [ElSemi].
- Added sliders for debugging crosshair positioning (debug build only) [Aaron Giles].
- Added support for screenless drivers [Aaron Giles, Nathan Woods].
- Added the missing volume and frequency controls to the Berzerk driver and s14001a core. Fixed the issue with random words being spoken instead of the proper ones. Word is now latched at the proper time [Lord Nightmare].
- Added win_output_debug_string_utf8(); a UTF-8 wrapper for OutputDebugString(). Changed code to use it [Nathan Woods].
- Changed automatic crosshairs so they are not quite so automatic. They now need to be explicitly specified by the driver in the input ports. Also changed the PORT_CROSSHAIR macro to take a shorter form of the axis name. Updated all lightgun drivers to have this macro in its default state [Aaron Giles].
- Changed driver_add/find/remove functions to fatalerror if they cannot find their targets [Aaron Giles].
- Changed Gorf to use HOLD_LINE instead of PULSE_LINE for scanline interrupts. The timing is still off, but the game runs now [Aaron Giles].
- Changed the contract of the tilemap_create() call so that it is guaranteed to succeed or die trying. Cleaned up code paths that  checked the result of this operation to be simpler as a result [Atari Ace, Aaron Giles].
- Changed xevious to use irq0_assert_line instead of irq0_pulse_line to prevent it from dropping interrupts [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned up DIP switches and added documentation to the Outrun driver [Brian Troha].
- Cleaned up stray variables from the crosshair drawing removal. Also removed some orphaned function declarations [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Correctly connected sound IRQ in GX400/Nemesis driver [R. Belmont].
- Defined new osd core function osd_is_absolute_path(). Changed behavior of core fileio so that absolute paths are identified and search paths ignored in that case [Nathan Woods].
- Emulated the trench circuit in Space Encounters [Adam Bousley].
- Fixed a couple of errors introduced in the OKI6295 pin shuffling [David Haywood].
- Fixed assertion in MPU4 driver. Fixed the mechanical meter operation, enabling coin entry in 'Connect 4' [James Wallace].
- Fixed clocks and other details in Dream World based on new measurements [David Haywood, Guru].
- Fixed sound clock frequency in 'Night Slasher' [Sonikos].
- Fixed sound clock frequency in the NMG5 driver [Brian Troha].
- Fixed the data fetch and scrolling calculation for almost all video modes in the Amiga driver [Ernesto Corvi].
- Fixed the disassembly, operation, and cycle timing of many Thumb instructions in the ARM7 core [MooglyGuy].
- Fixed time H/V position reporting during the first frame of execution using the new video routines [Aaron Giles].
- Implemented flickering of the strobe light in Space Encounters, to be eventually connected with artwork [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Implemented video circuits in the Midway 8080 driver based on schematics. Note that this affected the visible area, so overlays will need to be adjusted. Standardized the visible area across all games. Implemented Phantom II cloud generator [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Improved validity check for coinage order so that it prints out the correct order if an error is detected [Ernesto Corvi].
- Incorporated changes to MESS CPU cores to fix asserts and improve Z80GB emulation [Nathan Woods, Wilbert Pol].
- Moved some of the tool sources to a new subdirectory tools [Aaron Giles].
- Removed archaic i8080_EXACT flag from the 8085 core [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Removed line array from mame_bitmap. Converted dozens of drivers over to using BITMAP_ADDR macros instead [Aaron Giles].
- Rewrote the SN76477 emulator from scratch. The main difference between the old one and the new one is that it is based on measurements from a real chip. Also the emulator is fully analog, meaning that timings/frequencies, etc. are based on voltage levels. This gives a much more true-to-life emulation where the weird behavior of the real  chip comes emulated for free. The code itself is also a lot simpler and more understandable [Zsolt Vasvari, Derrick Renaud].
- Tweaked the main makefile to better support parallel builds [Aaron Giles].
- Updated Midway 8080 driver to use properly computed video timings and scanline interrupts [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Updated Sega System 16/18 drivers to be mono, and swapped button 1/2 to match instruction card [Corrado Tomaselli].
