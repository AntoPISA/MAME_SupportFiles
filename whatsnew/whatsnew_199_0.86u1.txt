Notes:
------
(1): No sound.
(2): *DISCLAIMER* I had trouble getting controls working in several of them.
(3): This is a gambling game and will probably be removed once the driver is complete, it's just here while it is developed.
(4): Very preliminary. Simple graphic layer hooked up, ROM banking hooked up in a way which allows ROM test to pass etc.
(5): Other set was US set (Recycle It Logo).
