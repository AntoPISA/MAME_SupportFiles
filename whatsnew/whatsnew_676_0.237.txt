Source changes:
---------------

New working software list additions (nes.xml)
---------------------------------------------
Dòngdòngn?o II: Guózh?ng Y?ngwén (I) (Taiwan) [MLX]

-debugger: Extended target address syntax to include device/address space (#8630) [Vas Crabb]
 * Added a validity check to ensure address space names are tag-like and unique, since they're now used as identifiers in debugger
    commands.
 * Extended the syntax for target addresses to allow them to be qualified with a colon followed by an optional device tag and/or
    address space name.  If only the device needs to be specified, a debugger CPU number may also be used.  This makes commands like
    bpset and wpset more flexible, as they can operate on CPUs other than the currently visible CPU.  Commands like find, fill, dump
    and load are more flexible as they can access any space of any device.
 * Removed now-redundant CPU parameters from many commands, and renamed pcatmemp to pcatmem for consistency with other commands.
    Extended region syntax for saver/loadr to support tags relative to the visible CPU (e.g. you can use "." for the region with the
    same name as the visible CPU, or "^sibling" syntax).  Added an optional root device parameter to memdump.  Changed
    interpretation of Boolean values to support numeric expressions as well as true/false strings and literal 1/0.
 * Added checks that the specified device is CPU-like to various commands that require a CPU (e.g. focus).  Previously these
    commands would crash or trigger an assertion failure if a tag for a non-CPU devices was specified.
 * Fixed the cpunum symbol so it uses the same rules for determining what is or isn't a CPU as parameter parsing.
 * Made device_t sanitise subtags better.  Previously you could cause an assertion failure or crash MAME by giving it unexpected
    relative tags via Lua or the debugger.
 * Added help topic alias support, and reworked the data structures to improve the performance of looking up debugger commands and
    help topics.  Removed the "ref" parameter from debugger command functions (std::bind can hold extra argument values for you if
    you need them).  Also added an error message if duplicate debugger commands are registered.
 * Updated help for commands that changed syntax, and also updated summaries for some commands that had changed in the past without
    corresponding help updates.

-m88000d: Clean up over/out flagging [AJR]

-snes.xml: Change "Prototype" and "Alt" to lowercase (#8685) [ArcadeShadow]
 * Changed various descriptive and disambiguation text to lowercase.

-frontend: Recovered precious vertical space for system/software names! [Vas Crabb]
 * Reduced the height of the bottom info panel by one line.  The system shortname or list/software name tuple are now only displayed
    in the info box on the right.  It's a bit out-of-the-way, but it's not something you need to see all the time.
 * The main reason for having the quit or return to previous menu item always visible is to make it easy for someone to quit if they
    only have a mouse.  However, we don't need waste space on the menu for this when we have a toolbar.  Users without a mouse can
    exit using the keyboard/controller UI Cancel input (given how important this is, it's unlikely they won't have it mapped to
    something usable).
 * There's now a toolbar button on the extreme right for returning to the previous menu or quitting.  The tooltip and icon are
    appropriately context-sensitive.  This recovers one line on the system selection menu, and two on the software selection menu
    since the separator is no longer needed.
 * Replaced the toolbar icons bitmaps with SVGs.  Colours/shapes may be tweaked before the release if people have good suggestions
 * Flipped the simple system selection menu so the description is on the left.
 * Moved the handling of special cases for the final menu item out of the base menu class.  It's still hacky having it handled there
    at all, but it's less hacky without if menus that want to do something different can do it themselves.

-RM Nimbus updates: (#8684) [prime6809]
 * Updated mouse handling so it mostly works
 * Updated SASI/SCSI code so that formatting disks with HDFORM works for ST125N and ST225N.
 * Added documentation of the video code drawn from the Nimbus Service manual.

-frontend: Fix another dumb clone sorting bug [Vas Crabb].

New working software list additions (nes.xml)
---------------------------------------------
Super RPG 5 in 1 (CH501) [NewRisingSun]

-frontend: Keep cleaning up [Vas Crabb].
 * Got rid of one of the UI audit inputs.  There only needs to be one, and the options can be presented in the confirmation menu.
    Two secret keystrokes is too confusing.  Also got rid of the long-obsolete UI Toggle Debugger input.
 * Added audit media button to the toolbar so it's a bit less opaque, and it can be accessed with a mouse/trackball (not just by
    knowing the key mapping).
 * Made default I/O port names localisable.
 * Made autofire plugin save port fields using the { port, mask, type } tuple, the same way MAME does.  Unfortunately this will
    break existing autofire configuration, but it should be more stable going forward.
 * Added some more UI keys to the default key mappings documentation.

-Updated Chinese translations. [YuiFAN]

-Re-generated translations for I/O port names [Vas Crabb].
 * Trying to collect messages from everything at once hits some limit in xgettext and causes messages to be lost no, so I've split
    it up by the second-level source directories.
 * For some reason xgettext thinks overloaded Lua functions are blasphemy, so that has to be worked around, too.

-luna_68k: boots to monitor [Patrick Mackinlay]

-bus/nes: Improved support for various VRC clone boards (#8687) [kmg]
 * Expanded VRC4 CHR bank regs to 9-bit. This functionality is verified on Konami VRC4 hardware as well but is only used by clones
    (World Hero here).
 * Removed board for World Hero. Its VRC4 clone chip is under a glop top but is thought to be identical to Konami's.
 * Reimplemented TF1201 (Lethal Weapon) as a VRC4 subclass. Its clone chip is only known to differ by the IRQ reload bit, which it
    ignores.
 * Reimplemented Shui Guan Pipe as a VRC4 subclass. Its clone chip has different PRG banking but is otherwise standard.

-nes.xml: Set correct board type for fjsanguo (#8670) [kmg]

-lckydraw, lckydrawa: made working in the electronic sense [Robbbert].

-More UI enhancements/cleanup [Vas Crabb]:
 * Made the headings in the info viewer clickable, so you can switch between DATs with a mouse or trackball (or maybe a lightgun if
    that's your thing).
 * Made the UI red/yellow/green traffic light status colours less dirty-looking.  The "yellow" is more of an amber-brown than a cat
    puke brown now, and red is brighter.  The contrast with white text is definitely fine for red and green, but it's reduced a bit
    for yellow. However there's a limit to how dark you can make a yellow or orange colour before it looks muddy.
 * Reduced the number of places the UI uses red for things that aren't errors.  The error colour should be used sparingly, for
    actual errors.
 * Improved the colour swatch display in the RGBA colour editor.  It now has black/white underlay so alpha effects are move obvious.
    Also fixed a bug preventing the channels being run down to zero.
 * Fixed double-clicking configure machine causing MAME to exit from the system selection menu.  Also slightly adjusted the colours
    of the toolbar buttons again.

-tms32082: rewrote the PP disassembler [Ville Linde]

-Various improvements to the user experience [Vas Crabb]:
 * Extended the memory access prefixes in debugger expressions to support address space names.
 * Made the debugger history command aware of how much history it has collected, and added a help topic for it to the built-in
    debugger help.
 * Started updating the documentation for the web site, and corrected some of the more misleading built-in debugger help.
 * Made some corrections to Chinese localisation after discussion with YuiFAN.
 * Darkened the UI red colour a little.
 * cpu/m6502/st2205u.h: Marked sound imperfect.

-konmedal020: add xga skeleton and few oak bits [cracyc]

-lckydraw: added coin counter [Robbbert].

-bujutsu: correct game title [hap]

-Updated Greek Translation (#8694) [BraiNKilleRGR]

-lckydrawa: added note [Robbbert]

-More user experience improvements [Vas Crabb]:
 * frontend: Allow clicking the adjuster arrows on menu items.  This allows things like video options and DIP switches to be
    configured using a mouse only.  Also fixed a bug preventing paging menus with a mouse if the first item scrolled off the bottom
    is not selectable.
 * debugger: Allow wplist and bplist to accept a CPU argument to list breakpoints/watchpoints for a single CPU only.
 * debugger: Fixed some corner cases in address space syntax in memory accesses, and allowed memory region accesses to use tags
    relative to the visible CPU.
 * emu/softlist.cpp: Ignore notes elements when loading software lists. It's effectively a comment that isn't a comment
    syntactically, it's being used for things that are not useful to display in the internal UI, and it slows down startup.
 * docs: Updated three more pages of debugger documentation.  Also updated more of the built-in debugger help.
 * minimaws: Fixed up schema for software list notes, made sofware list notes display initially collapsed.

    (Clock Tower at least) in Akumajo Densetsu.

-bus/nes: Added a couple bootleg games using VRC2 clone hardware (#8699) [kmg]
 * Also convert 900218 board from VRC4 clone to VRC2 clone.

New working software list additions (nes.xml)

Batman - The Video Game (Brazil, pirate) [Fisher]
Fudou Myouou Den (pirate) [anonymous]

-a1supply.cpp updates [Ivan Vangelista]:
 * dumped another PCB for TV Poker [f205v]
 * PCBs use a 4040 CPU
 * added NO_DUMPs to tv21_3 set
 * updated ROM labels

-More user experience improvements [Vas Crabb]:
 * frontend: Made it possible to cancel a media audit while it's in progress.  Also made the media audit multi-threaded so it's
    faster.
 * frontend: Made the DIP switches in the DIP switch preview clickable.
 * frontend: Made the system and software selection menus leave focus on the same system when clearing the search rather than
    jumping to the first item.  Also fixed a couple of bugs in the logic for keeping the selected item visible.
 * frontend: Fixed a few places that weren't showing localised system names.
 * frontend: Made UI Cancel clear a search in the file manager the same way it does on the system and sofware selection menus.
 * frontend: Made it possible for plugin menus to handle UI Cancel more naturally, backing up to the previous plugin menu rather
    than dropping straight back to the list of plugins.  Updated the autofire, cheat and cheatfind plugins, and fixed a few other
    issues in the cheatfind plugin.
 * debugger: Made the mount and unmount commands accept instance names as well as brief instance names.  Also updated another page
    of debugger documentation.

-frontend: Show full sofware name in right panel for favourites, too [Vas Crabb].

-frontend: Two bug fixes [Vas Crabb].
 * Audit menu was using one variable for two things, which obviously doesn't work.
 * DIP switch menu could trigger spurious clicks on for systems with too many DIP switch groups to show.
 * Also work around Xcode's issues with casting non-const to const reference wrappers.

-Actually commit the workaround for Xcode's issues with reference wrapper casts [Vas Crabb].

-Fixed E7 cracks, some additional new apple2_flop_clcracked disks (#8537) [Firehawke]
 * A number of Apple II cleanly cracked disks were re-cracked due to a compatibility issue with IWM disk controllers on Apple
    IIc/IIgs machines; while MAME was not affected by this issue, these sets are being treated as promoted to working as real
    hardware still exists to use these disk images.
 * Imperfect E7 cracks will not function on specific combinations of drives and newer Apple II machines due to subtle timing issues,
    but run fine on MAME and other emulators. Some, mostly Epyx, were not previously.

megadriv.xml: Mortal Kombat (prototype) [drx, The Hidden Palace]

-frontend: Cleaned up rendering of info views [Vas Crabb].
 * Put the description for systems in the info box - it's useful for the fruit machines with very long names that are truncated in
    the list. Also stopped truncating manufactuer and parent name in the info box.
 * Made the text layout class capable of handling lines containing combinatations of left/centre/right-justified text and got rid of
    the legacy UI manager text wrapping function.  Made the system/software selection menus and the info viewer share the same code
    for formatting info text.  This means the multi-column layout works properly in the info viewer now, and the code is a lot
    simpler.  Also the system/software selection menus don't have to redo the text layout every frame now.
 * Made the info viewer update the text layout if the output aspect ratio changes, and cleaned up more legacy code.  The lines in
    the info viewer are no longer bogus "menu items", and there's a lot less special-case code to support it in the base menu class.
 * This commit includes an update to the Chinese translations from YuiFAN.

-Regenerate and patch up translation files for latest UI work [Vas Crabb].

-frontend: Better code for carrying justification across when wrapping [Vas Crabb].

-frontend: fixed horizontal offset on text boxes with blank lines [Vas Crabb].

-frontend: Further improved behaviour of info box on system selection menu, and fixed alignment issues [Vas Crabb].

 * Add configuration methods to define initial state for DREQ inputs being active low (or high)
 * Add a few more internal helper functions
 * Disable side effects of reads for debugging

-bus/nes: Continued work on VRC4 and clone boards (#8713) [kmg]
 * Tweaked VRC4 class to make it easier to extend for clones and multicarts. The main new pieces are: a centralized and more
    flexible function for PRG banking and an overridable IRQ acknowledge function.
 * Added support for 830506C board.
 * Added support for unknown board for Yu Yu Hakusho/Dragon Ball Z 2-in-1.

Instituto Latinoamericano de la Comunicación Educativa / Secretaría de Educación Pública Micro-SEP 1600 [Tim Lindner]

-Still more user experience improvements [Vas Crabb]:
 * Changed the default mapping for UI select to not trigger on Alt+Enter fullscreen toggle.  (Fullscreen toggle still doesn't work
    in menus - actually fixing that is complicated.)
 * frontend: Made the about box wrap text properly, made the title and backtrack menu item always visible, and added a footer with
    the VCS revision.
 * frontend: Don't highlight the favourites and info toolbar buttons if there's no selection (can happen if filters produce no
    results).  Also made the info viewer appear even if no info is available - it's less confusing to see an empty menu than wonder
    why clicking the button does nothing.
 * debugger: Added a register points view to the GUI debuggers, to go with the breakpoints and watchpoints views.
 * debugger: Extended [brw]p(clear|(en|dis)able) commands to accept multiple arguments to perform the same action on multiple
    (break|watch|register)points at once.  Also made rplist accept a CPU for showing a single CPU's register points ([bw]plist
    already support this).
 * docs: Updated registerpoints debugger commands page, and updated other pages for latest extensions to syntax.

-Add new files to SDL OSD as well as Mac OSD [Vas Crabb].

-pc_vga: add xga blits [cracyc]

-gst80,gts80a,gts80b: WIP. Some games can be played [Robbbert].

-Better rules for generating .po files - multiple jobs have an effect now [Vas Crabb].

-Revert "Better rules for generating .po files - multiple jobs have an effect now." [Vas Crabb]
 * Need to find a better way of doing this without causing .po files to be rebuilt on every build.  The commit is still there for
    reference.
 * This reverts commit efe9c1e7283e6a0ca5f4fc57a832430e656399ef.

-gts80: added a list of known alternate roms [Robbbert]

-bus/nes: Corrections for SL-1632 board (#8719) [kmg]

 * Updated cheat commands to work with arbitrary devices and address spaces.  You can still only search RAM areas in a single
    address space at a time, but any address space of any device can be used now.
 * Made the cheatinit/cheatrange commands not affect current state if the arguments are invalid.  Also fixed some bugs in the cheat
    commands.
 * Updated documentation for cheat commands, and added a simple worked example.  Also added single-sentence descriptions of what
    (break|watch|register)points are to the top of the relevant pages.

-frontend improvements [Vas Crabb]:
 * Added a bit more info to the about box, moved the VCS revision to the heading.
 * Don't show "not" codes in prompts - they're not helpful.

 as soon as it loads but surprisingly the original Ocean release (added on this PR) with different tape loading software works OK.

-Plugin usability improvements [Vas Crabb]:
 * autofire, inputmacro: Made left/right repeat when held (makes setting long delays/durations easier).

    e.g. AES)
 * autofire: Made intial selection when moving between menus intuitive, log some errors on saving/loading configuration.
 * autofire: Fixed two errors in Chinese localisations.

-Cleaned up CI targets [Vas Crabb]:
 * Restricted Linux CI build to only run on changes to code, translations, software lists, and build scripts.
 * Restricted Windows/macOS CO to only run on changes to code and build scripts.  They provide nothing over Linux for the other
    stuff.
 * Added plugin properties and controller file validation to the "hash" workflow.
 * Added a workflow for building documentation, so pull requests that affect documentation will at least get a basic check in
    advance.

-Note that I have also added a reason why Cobra is not supported which was pointed out in PR#8689. [Steven Coomber]

-Filled in Japanese names for a bunch of inputs, fixed issues with localised P10 control names not showing [Vas Crabb].

-shootgal: Adjusted MAME's crosshair to match actual crosshair (#8739) [aequites7]
 * Shooting Gallery (shootgal)'s default PORT_CROSSHAIR values are reverse and unscaled against the game's screen resolution.
 * The game does not offer a calibration option, but the test mode that comes up after a few seconds upon setting the DIP switch
    shows the internal crosshair for adjusting the gun.
 * The new offsets are manually determined. They are visual cues for the MAME users only and are unrelated to the game's operation.

-apple2gs: ROM 0/1 have the $C028 ROMSWITCH, support it [R. Belmont].

-Plugin updates [Vas Crabb]:
 * Changed the hiscore plugin to save inside the "hiscore" folder in the plugin data directory.  The old hiscore path setting has
    already been removed from MAME for some time.  This means the plugin was always saving in the "hi" folder in the working
    directory with no way to change it, which is problematic on Linux and macOS, particularly for distro packagers.  There are lots
    of plugin and UI changes in this release, so we may as well get this out of the way now.  Also made it possible to change the
    "timed save" option from the Plugin Options menu, and save that in the data folder, too.
 * Documented the input macro plugin.  The only undocumented plugins now are the cheat plugin, the cheat finder plugin, and the port
    name plugin.

 rather than CC0 [Vas Crabb].
