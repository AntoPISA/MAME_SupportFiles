Source changes:
---------------
- Add libjpeg; converted Sliver to decompress pictures on the fly [David Haywood, R. Belmont].
- Added documentation (pinout/dips/chip ID) for popobear based on PCB picture and manual [Tafoid].
- Added FLAC (lossless audio) codec support plus experimental hooks in samples and chdman.  Bumped up CHD-CD hunk size to get better compression ratios on both zlib and flac [David Haywood, R. Belmont].
- Added Intersil IM6402 UART emulation [Curt Coder].
- Added Pluto 5 technical notes about clocks, EPROM config, and addresses/data scrambling for different EPROM types on 16-bit mode [Roberto Fresca].
- CGA: Fixed display disable read flag [Angelo Salese].
- Changes for GCC 4.7 compatibility [Belegdol].
- Converted Lemmings, Wizard Fire, Desert Assault, Rohga and Schmeiser Robo to use DECO generic sprite device [David Haywood].
- Fixed bad assumption by the (pre)GX video mixer [R. Belmont].
- Fixed pcap network device search [Carl].
- Fixed some DIP switch defaults and added diplocations to many Konami and Namco games [kanikani].
- Fixed VGA memory map writes [Grull Osgo].
- floppy: Do specific UI handling [Olivier Galibert].
- Further Stepper clean-ups [J. Wallace].
- i386: Stopped IOPL from being changed by IRET when CPL is zero. Made stack limit checks better handle the difference between 16 and 32-bit stacks in IRET and RETF. Fixed STR and SLDT instructions. Fixed BSR/BSF and CMPS based on test-i386 output. Basic implementation of FIST and FBLD FPU instructions. Added 32-bit operand size version of SMSW [Barry Rodewald].
- i386: Various protection mode fixes. Major update to segment limit and protection checking. Fixed a bug with JCXZ opcode. BTR and page fault fixes [Carl].
- ksys573: Fix disk regions, games boot again [R. Belmont].
- Major overhaul of VGA memory handlers, added CGA, monochrome emulation and fixed text banking while at it [Angelo Salese].
- Move devices into a proper hierarchy and handle naming and paths consistently for devices, I/O ports, memory regions, memory banks, and memory shares [Aaron Giles].
- oki6295: Force creation of banks so loading a state from after the game has set a bank before the game sets the bank doesn't die [R. Belmont].
- ppu2c0x: Converted NES PPU to be a modern device [Fabio Priuli].
- Remove support for 4bpp packed graphics. These only manifested for drivers that used GFX_RAW support for 4bpp systems, and yet we had a bunch of extra code to support it. Updated these drivers to do without it and removed all the extra code for supporting it. [Aaron Giles].
- Rewrote i386 x87 emulation [Phil Bennett]:
  * Implemented stack underflow/overflow behaviour;
  * Implemented status word/exception flag updates;
  * Implemented tag word updates;
  * Use SoftFloat arithmetic functions.
- Rewrote tilemap.c as a C++ class. For now kept the global functions and just inline mapped them to the class. Will do a pass soon to actually update drivers to use the C++ methods directly. Also, the tilemap callbacks are now delegates which should make for cleaner integrating into modern devices and drivers going forward [Aaron Giles].
- SDL: Don't show misleading message for .BDF UI fonts [R. Belmont, The Flying Ape].
- tagmap is just a C++ template now. Added iterators to it as well. Updated a few outlying uses [Aaron Giles].
- taitogn: Fix card region, games boot again [R. Belmont].
- Verified and corrected the Sega Security CPU number (317-xxxx) for one of the two unknown Turbo Out Run sets [Brian Troha].
- VGA: first attempt at adding proper refresh rates [Angelo Salese].
- VGA: Fixed Double Scan / Maximum Scan Lines condition, and removed a bunch of kludges [Angelo Salese].
