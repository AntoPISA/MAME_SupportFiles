- Redumped all the Super Star '97 graphics ROMs as TC531000 mask ROMs [Siftware, Quench, Guru].
- device_gfx_interface and memory system improvements [Alex Jackson]:
  * Added macros to facilitate declaring gfxdecode info arrays as members of a device class;
  * AM_SHAREs in a device's internal address map or its default address map are now tagmapped as children of that device rather than siblings (analogous to how handlers in internal/default address maps are scoped).
- Fixed bloom misalignment with HLSL [MooglyGuy].
- Maygay M1 and MV1 converted to standard i8279 drivers [J. Wallace].
- konamigx: Reverb me harder baby! [Olivier Galibert].
- namcona1.c improvements [Alex Jackson]:
  * Rewrite tilemap drawing code;
  * Use set_palette_offset;
  * Use GFXDECODE_RAM;
  * ROM loading and miscellaneous cleanups.
- Chihiro improvements [Samuele Zannoli]:
  * i386 cpu x87 opcodes FPREM and FPREM1 must clear status bit C2 not C0;
  * Add basic management of some Nvidia APU sound registers;
  * Store modelview/projection matrices and translate/scale vectors sent to NV2A;
  * Store vertex program (vertex shader) sent to NV2A 3d accelerator;
  * Added debug command "chihiro grab_texture,<type>,<filename>", it saves to <filename> the next used texture of type <type>;
  * Fixed DXT3 and adds DXt5 texture decompression.
  * Add 3d accelerator method 0x1800 for indexed mode vertex sending.
- Added PIC dump to Mega Phoenix [Enricnes (from AUMAP)].
- bladestl.c: Simplify ROM loading, reduce tagmap lookups [Alex Jackson].
- BFM BD1 and ROC10937 now have proper device line accessors for the clock (sclk), reset (por) and data (data). All affected drivers have been updated to use these [J. Wallace].
- corefile: Don't crash on 0-length files [Olivier Galibert].
- Added vblank bit in Model 2 Old Revision, fixes Virtua Cop booting [Angelo Salese].
- Hooked up lightgun inputs in Virtua Cop [Angelo Salese].
- Fixes for PowerPC AltiVec compile [Vas Crabb].
- Fix tools build on OS/2 [KO Myung-Hun].
- sh2.c: Modernised CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- cvs.c: Updated the driver to use modern speech ROM reading [Fabio Priuli] .
- tms5110.c: Removed legacy handlers, now that no drivers use them anymore [Fabio Priuli].
- network: Please don't kill save states [Olivier Galibert].
- nscsi: Save some state [Olivier Galibert].
- m68k: Update used and modified bits in the page tables and greatly improved PTEST results on 68040 [R. Belmont].
- tatsumi.c: Filled in missing DIP switches and added DIP switch locations to Round Up 5 - Super Delta Force [Brian Troha].
- SDL: Fix OS X compile with non-official SDL [R. Belmont, based on a patch by Fernando Lemos].
- Netlist: All analysis is now based on an immutable list of terminals. The dynamic list now is only used in the "hot" core. This is the base for possible further optimizations using multiple lists; e.g. a high-low transition list and a low-high transition list [Couriersud].
- Fix transparency in SDL2.0 code [Couriersud].
- CPS-1 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Added full documentation to (nemoa);
  * Rename (nemoa) to (nemor1) to follow the new cps1 standard;
  * Minor reorder and cleanup.
- MC68681: support timer-driven serial channels. Fixes SC4 fruit machine games [R. Belmont].
- SCSI Port using WRITELINE and DEVCB2. The slot number and SCSI ID are separate so you can for example have -harddisk1 as ID 6 and -harddisk 2 as ID 5. The HLE'd CD & HD have configuration switches to set the ID, real emulated hardware will specify the ID using it's own method [smf].
- gp9001.c (toaplan2.c): Convert to device_gfx_interface, cleanups [Alex Jackson].
- Fix brightness sliders in drivers that use black_pen() and/or white_pen() [Alex Jackson].

- Use the correct call to free memory in windows osd_close [smf].
- Simplified netlist code. It now always provides a stable solution instead of rescheduling the solver [Couriersud].
- Naomi: Documentation update [f205v].
- memory: Stop the watchpoints from messing with the opcode decryption [Olivier Galibert].
- emupal.c: Add support for RAM-based palettes with indirect lookups. Update various drivers to use it [Alex Jackson].

  * Fixed uninitialized struct on MSVC (and possibly other) builds.
- Naomi: Small correction to World Kicks game code [f205v].
- cdrom: Fix uninitialized flags [MetalliC].
- ym2612: Sync timer fixes from GenPlus-GX, fixes MT #5049 [Enik Land].

- mccs1850: Fix multi-write [Olivier Galibert].
- Naomi updates [MetalliC]:
  * 5 more BAD_DUMP GD-ROMs redumped from source;
  * All SHA1s updated to latest. 'chdman copy' on existing valid CHDs will update your files to the new SHA1s.
- ioport_array_finder: ioport_array_finder is a new device finder template for finding, unsurprisingly, an array of ioports. It is mainly intended to help handle multiplexed ioports without runtime tagmap lookups in a more elegant way than was previously possible [Alex Jackson].
- TMS34010: Use the CONVSP/CONVDP registers to adjust source and destination addresses when window clipping or y-reverse is applied [Phil Bennett].
- inder_vid.c: Mirrored TMS34010 RAM at 0x7fc00000 and 0xffc00000. With the previous TMS34010 change, this fixes the window clipping issues at y=0 [Phil Bennett].
- mb8795: Fix packet sizes [Olivier Galibert].
- cyberbal.c: Use separate palette for each screen [Alex Jackson].
- mc6847: Added internal character generator ROM and M5C6847P-1 variant [Curt Coder, Anna Wu].
- mc6847: Added character generator ROM for S68047 [Curt Coder].
- h8: Fix missing debugger hook calls [Olivier Galibert].
- Made osd_interface base class for OSD and moved initialization for each subsystem in it as virtual calls [Miodrag Milanović]:
  * Moved midi handling in base class;
  * Cleaned running_machine of information of next machine;
  * All is cleaned after exiting of running_machine so debugger window is removed as well till next machine is started;
  * Made osdmini to compile.
- h8_sci: Implement sync-start [Olivier Galibert].
- h8: Fix problem in the sleep instruction [Olivier Galibert].
- at45dbxx: Fix communications [Olivier Galibert].
- s3: Added Diamond Stealth 3D 2000 Pro card [Malice, Barry Rodewald].
- voodoo: Fixed alpha test to run on the alpha combiner output and not on a_other. Do the test before the color combiner steps to potentially save some effort [Phil Bennett].
- Improvements to "The Berlin Wall" [Luca Elia]:
  * Scrambling of sprite offset registers (fixes MT bug 493);
  * background: Added scroll register (screen shaking effect), fixed flipping;
  * Fixed flipped tilemap offset.
- funworld.c: Proper decryption of rcdino4 code pages [Peter Ferrie].
- Merged video/gticlub functionality to K001005/1006 devices. Converted K001005 to use the new poly manager [Ville Linde].
- CHD cleanups [MetalliC]:
  * Double quote filenames with spaces when writing .gdi files;
  * Give audio files .raw. extension when writing .gdi files;
  * cdrom_read_subcode() now returns false if the image doesn't contain subcodes.

- SDL: Fix 0.153 regression where user GLSL shaders didn't work [R. Belmont].
- SDL: Fix shaders for games that output indexed16 (e.g. pacman) [R. Belmont].
- namcos1.c: Completely rewrote the emulation of the CUS117 MMU. The MMU is no longer emulated by modifying address maps at runtime, an operation which has become excessively slow as the core memory system has accumulated features and complexity over the years. Instead, the MMU is now a device which works on similar principles to the address_map_bank_device. The recent multisession regression is fixed, all games in the driver should now run substantially faster, and most importantly the driver code is now much cleaner and easier to understand [Alex Jackson].
- chihiro.c: Update [f205v]:
  * Added exact release dates, GDX info and descriptions for all known existing games/releases not yet secured or dumped;

- nscsi_cd: I told'ya, there's no disk in the drive [Olivier Galibert].
- Updated m72.c with a Guru-readme for Ninja Spirit. Changed labels where appropriate to match information and added PALs/PROMs [Guru].
- NeoGeo (multi)slot work [S. Smith, David Haywood]:
  * Converted all protection types to be MAME devices;
  * Created cartridge (slot) device types for each type of cartridge containing the above protection devices:
  * Made the 'neogeo' set emulate a 6-slot MVS system allowing for multiple cartridges to be mounted, for example "mame64 neogeo -cart1 mslug -cart2 mslugx -cart3 mslug3" is the command-line syntax to launch an MVS unit with 3 Metal Slug games installed;
  - Many of the hacks / bootlegs won't work in multi-slot setups, this is true to hardware;
  - Some carts (kof95, kof2002 for example) can block recognition of carts in higher slots if the NVRAM isn't already initialized. This appears to be true to original hardware because the kof95h set fixes this issue, powering off/on the system fixes it;
  - Sound banking isn't 100% correctly handled so the odd game may fail with the slot system (trally) but regular loading still works;
  - The slot / multislot support makes use of the Software Lists rather than the internal sets, please ensure the correct softlist XML file is present in your hash folder.
- i86.c: 0x60 shadow omitted in previous patch. Needed for DOS 2 [Bavarese].
- Add width and endianness attributes to data areas in software lists. Update neogeo.xml and megadriv.xml to take advantage of them [Alex Jackson].
- m6502: Remove expensive and unused attotime precalculation at start of each timeslice [Alex Jackson].
- funworld.c: Inserted some more switches, Saloon now boots, and service mode is mostly working.  Added default NVRAM to jolycrdb, game seems to work now [Peter Ferrie].
- sh2: Fix and enable memory system bypass for SH-1 & SH-2 DRC [R. Belmont].
- schedule.c: Make yield() actually yield again, rather than be a synonym for spin() [Alex Jackson].
- schedule.c: rebuild_execute_list() after loading a savestate to ensure the order of execution remains consistent. Fixes 0.153 savestate regressions in various drivers [Alex Jackson].
- nec v25: Implement programmable clock divider via execute_clocks_to_cycles() instead of set_clock_scale(). Properly restore the clock divider on state load [Alex Jackson].
