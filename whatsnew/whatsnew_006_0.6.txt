- I'm beginning to understand how the Wizard of Wor video hardware works, gameplay hasn't changed but the graphics are more faithfully reproduced [Nicola Salmoria].
- Star background in Galaxians & co. The way I calculate it is probably not correct, anyway it looks reasonable [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed staccato notes in Pacman and other games using the same hardware. There are still some minor glitches (especially in Ms. Pac Man) but Pac Man tunes are now very close to the original [Nicola Salmoria].


Source changes:
---------------
- I reorganized the source directory tree, instead of one directory for every game there are now four directories (drivers, machine, vidhrdw, sndhrdw) which contain files named after the game [Nicola Salmoria].
