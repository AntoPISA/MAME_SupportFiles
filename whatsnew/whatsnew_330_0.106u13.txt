Source changes:
---------------
- Added more previously dumped PLDs to a number of games [MASH].
- Fixed bug that caused -prescale in Direct3D mode to fail in the last release [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed bug that led to black crosshairs in lightgun games [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed uninitialized variable in the debugger commenting code. Cleaned up allocations [Nathan Woods].
- Hooked up color PROM for schaser and fixed DIP switches [Robbbert].
- Improved multisession support with the new renderer [Nathan Woods].
- More "Crystal Castles" tweaks [Aaron Giles]:
  * Connected EAROM correctly (passes POST now);
  * Added a guess for what the "POTATO" chip does. If you're a CC fan report to MAMETesters how MAME looks compared to the arcade when the screen scrolls up inbetween level 4 and 5.
- Reimplemented the sparkle circuit to bring back stars in Tempest [Aaron Giles].
- Removed the background brightness in vector games by default. If you want to see the overlays faintly on vector games, increase the brightness a bit [Aaron Giles].
- Rewrote 'Cloud 9' driver to mimic the 'Crystal Castles' driver since it is obviously an early version of the same hardware [Aaron Giles]:
  * Implemented video RAM banking correctly based on tracing out a Firebeast PCB, which appears to be identical;
  * Traced out color mapping and implemented correctly;
  * Reduced EAROM down to 4 bits;
  * Fixed DIP switch definitions.
- Some minor modernization of the xxmissio driver [Aaron Giles].
- Some more fixes for the DTD in the -listxml output [Krick].
