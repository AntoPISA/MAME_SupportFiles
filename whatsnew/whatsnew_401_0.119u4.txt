Source changes:
---------------
- Moved Hayaoshi Quiz Ouza Ketteisen to its own driver [David Haywood].
- Added coin counters to cabal bootleg and hooked up the 2 sample player CPUs in cabal bootleg. It seems there still are some problems, because  the coin up music is played during the game [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- More improvements to the Vs. Janshi Brandnew Stars driver [David Haywood].
- More SCSP improvements [El Semi]:
  * Fixed endianness issue on 8-bit samples and added interpolation;
  * Disabled modulation attempt (should fix the crash problems);
  * Tweeked pitch calculation.
- Added the repeat count register (reg 0x34) access and immediate value load to the MB86233 core (needed by Pilot kids) [El Semi].
- Cleaned up the inputs, and fixed flipscreen in dynax.c [Luca Elia].
- Fixed several issues in seibuspi.c [Couriersud]:
  * Added sound to (rdft2us);
  * Added coin-handling to single board games;
  * Fix interrupt handling;
  * For rfjetus, adds a hack to enable Test-Switch to enter testmode if no NVRAM exists.
- Fixed several issues in the i386 core [Couriersud]:
  * The INTR-line for i386 is a "level" line; changed interrupt handling to trigger on asserted line;
  * In 32bit mode, determine trap/interrupt from gate-header;
  * Interrupt line is read during two bus cycles. Adjust CYCLES accordingly.
- Added coin DIP switches and "teleport hole" DIP switch to crushs [sonikos].
- Bug fixes for the z80gb cpu core [Wilbert Pol]:
  * Fixed cycle count for taking an interrupt;
  * Fixed cycle count for BIT X,(HL) instructions;
  * Fixed flags in RRCA instruction;
  * Fixed DAA instruction;
  * Fixed flags in ADD SP,n8 instruction;
  * Fixed flags in LD HL,SP+n8 instruction.
- Fixed the linking issues when specifying MSVC_BUILD=1 and DEBUG=1 [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Fixed a compile error on architectures where "char" is unsigned (notably some PowerPC configurations) [Bill Blake].
- Added two more filters to the headon crash sound. Now, only the envelopes for the crash sound filters are missing [Couriersud].
- Loverboy input fixes [wolf676]:
  * Added and verified all DSW;
  * Added and verified Button1 for both players.
- Added color PROMs for 'Cannon Ball' [Rob Walmsley].
- Fixed several out-of-bounds array accesses in the code [Andi].
- Fixed mask ROM test in prmrsocr [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed 64-bit DRC bug that broke kinst in the previous release [Aaron Giles].
- Added code to detect potential hotspots in the 64-bit DRC. Added hotspots to all the seattle.c games and several of the vegas.c games [Aaron Giles].
- Simplified the osd_work implementation. Removed the concept of shared work items. Added new function osd_work_item_queue_multiple() which allows efficient queueing of large numbers of work items. Changed previous osd_work_item_queue() function into an inline that calls the new function [Aaron Giles].
- Updated Voodoo code to use the new work functions. It now queues small scanline chunks as independent items rather than using shared items. Updated code to also copy some parameters to allow for greater overlapping of emulation and rendering [Aaron Giles].
- For Windows work functions, added new scalable lock implementation that hopefully has better performance characteristics when scaling above 2 CPUs [Aaron Giles].
- For Windows work functions, added statistics gathering code. This is on by default for the moment to help point to problems that might be encountered with this version [Aaron Giles].
