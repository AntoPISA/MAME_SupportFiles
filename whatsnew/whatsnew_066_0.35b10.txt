These drivers have improved GRAPHICS
------------------------------------
- Fixed colors in 'Birdie King 2' [Zsolt Vasvari].


Other drivers changes
---------------------
- "kbmame" multi-button key equivalents for the NeoGeo games. They are only available if cheats are enabled [Nicola Salmoria].


Source changes:
---------------
- [DOS] Fixed severe slowdowns when 16-bit audio was selected [Nicola Salmoria].
- [DOS] The parameters which control tweaked VGA modes can be changed by editing mame.cfg, so they can be fine tuned to match each particular video card/monitor combination (these are non standard modes so they can't be made to work in the same way on all setups). If you want to try that (warning: only experienced users should try) make sure to read vgatweak.txt [Valerio Verrando].
- Added menu option to configure the default joystick settings (like the default keys) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added support for up to 4 analog controllers (multiple trackballs are NOT supported under DOS, but multiple joysticks should work) [Brad Oliver].
- Changed format of the history database [John Butler].
- Reorganized the sound subsystems, hopefully I didn't break anything in the process [Nicola Salmoria].
