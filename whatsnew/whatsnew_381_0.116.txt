Mahjong G-Taste [David Haywood]

New clones added
----------------
Buzzard [Zsolt Vasvari]


Source changes:
---------------
- Major Donkey Kong driver update [Couriersud]:
  * Implemented discrete sound from schematics: dkong, radarscp.
  * Implemented discrete background from schematics for radarscp and various effects:
  - Blue to black to blue background.
  - Exact priorities.
  - Grid will flip open and close, vertical flipping on hit.
  * Changed inputs for radarscp
  * Color generation from schematics (resistor mixer) for radarscp, dkong, dkongjr and dkong3.
- Added new components to the discrete sound system [Couriersud]:
  * Added a "inverter oscillator" component. This can also be used as a raw sine generator - needed by radarscp.
  * Added a "integration circuit" based on transistor and RC.
  * Added a "modulated RC discharge" component.
- Removed unused return value from VIDEO_START callbacks [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Improved independence of CPU and sound core variants in order to make them more properly separated by the existing compile-time flags [Atari Ace].
- More TIA updates from MESS [Wilbert Pol]:
  * Rewrote drawing of playing graphics.
  * Improved handling of player graphics reset signals.
  * Improved handling of HMOVE signals.
- Updates to Change Lanes [Adam Bousley]:
  * Fixed the broken graphics.
  * Fixed the dipswitches.
  * Hooked up the steering wheel controls.
  * Made some changes to the sprite and text layers. based on schematics.
- Fixed up a number of places where malloc results weren't being checked correctly [Atari Ace].
- Renamed palette_set_color() to palette_set_color_rgb().  palette_set_color() now matches palette_get_color() and deals in rgb_t data only. Also changed palette_set_colors() to deal with rgb_t data instead of R,G,B triples [Aaron Giles].
- Flattened colormap and palette in the 1942 driver [Aaron Giles].
- Removed usage of unsigned char/short/int from the drivers code in favor of UINT8/UINT16/UINT32.
