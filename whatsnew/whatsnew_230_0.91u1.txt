Source changes:
---------------
- Compiler Warning fixes for non-GCC compiles [Bryan McPhail]:
  * cpuintrf.h: Duplicate enum;
  * cpu/mh68hc11/hc11ops.c: C99 variable fix and warning fix;
  * sound/streams.c: C99 variable fix;
  * vidhrdw/pacman.c: C99 variable fix;
  * vidhrdw/model3.c: C99 variable fix, unused variable fix;
  * vidhrdw/namcona1.c: Fixed unused variable warning;
  * vidhrdw/taitoic.c: Fixed unused variable warning;
  * vidhrdw/wgp.c: Fixed unused variable warning;
  * windows/debugwin.c: Missing #include.
- More compiler fixes [Lawrence Gold]:
  * Trailing comma at the end of an enum;
  * src/cpu/mc68hc11/mc68hc11.c: ANSI C89 unfortunately doesn't allow unnamed structs or unions, so I had to uglify this code a bit. A cleaner solution is welcome;
  * Returning a value from a void function.
- Even more compiler fixes [Lawrence Gold].
- Fixed SFTM on 64-bit builds/systems [R. Belmont].
- Changes to Lethal Enforces [R. Belmont]:
  * Implemented 48xx bankswitch region, which can toggle between custom chip registers and RAM (evil!);
  * Removed hack to pass POST since we now do it the right way;
  * Corrected 56832 RAM interface, added preliminary support for external linescroll RAM on the 56832. This helps with the garbage tilemaps a bit since linescroll data is no longer getting sprayed all over VRAM (note, with this update the driver was just crashing when I tested it, so maybe something is wrong).
- NEC disassembler update [Bryan McPhail]:
  * Added support for encrypted opcodes in i386 disassembler (for Irem games);
  * Added some of the NEC V series instructions into i386 disassembler.
- Fixed bug in memory system introduced in 0.91, this was breaking at least Kinst, the Seattle driver, and wwally. [Aaron Giles].
- Qix driver update [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * Fixed hang in Electric Yo-Yo attract;
  * External volume control and stereo support [Derrick Renaud];
  * Decrypted kram3, which is now working, unfortunately using large tables.
- Fixed missing net in Super Vollyball [David Haywood].
- Fixed garbage around life-bars in (rabiolep) [David Haywood].
- Fixed? Blanking out of levels at certain scores in Solomons Key. This appears to be some basic protection, needs further investigation [David Haywood].
- Fixed Zero Zone background banking [David Haywood].
