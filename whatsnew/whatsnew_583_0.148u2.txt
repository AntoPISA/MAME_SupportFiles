Source changes:
---------------
- Removed runtime ioport tagmap lookup when using PORT_CONDITION with PORT_BIT, used by gmgalax for example [smf].
- Moved some of the saturn code from mame/ into emu/ and made saturn.c & stv.c separately compilable. Still needs work before saturn.c can be moved to mess/ [smf].
- upd1771.c: Further documentation updates based on the NEC APC technical manual; now all pin names except two are known. [Lord Nightmare].
- Modernized the MOS6526, MOS6560, MOS7360, MOS6581, CBM IEC, and IEEE-488 devices [Curt Coder].
- mos6551: Added serial callbacks [Curt Coder].
- fmtowns: Preliminary implementation of the CD-ROM controller's software mode.  Enough to get the CD-ROM working under Win95 [Barry Rodewald].
- Improved protection in Steep Slope Sliders [Angelo Salese].
- Added a more sane ST-V SMPC Intback command emulation, based off Saturn version. Fixes inputs in 'Find Love' [Angelo Salese].
- emuopts.c: Avoid slots without user configurable options to write their configs at exit [Fabio Priuli].
- Fixed protection check in Tecmo World Cup '98, game is now playable (Tecmo logo & Title Screen still garbled) [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed SMPC change clock behaviour, fixes 2 credits at start-up for various ST-V games [Angelo Salese].
- input: Support up to 32 buttons and harmonize Windows and SDL behavior if you exceed the limit [Nick3092].
- Fixed SH-2 DMAC irqs, fixes at least hard-locking on 'Baroque' [Angelo Salese].
- Modernized tms3615, es8712, cem3394, k051649, rf5c400, rf5c68, tms36xx, polepos, redbaron, cps3, tiamc1, gridlee, gomoku, astrocade, saa1099, st0016, c140, beep, taitosnd, CRT, okim6285, and ZSG2 devices [Andrew Gardner].

- galdrvr.c: Corrected ROM labels for Scorpion and redumped set 2 [tirino73].
- scramble.c: Corrected ROM labels for Harem. Corrected dipswitches for 'Harem' [tirino73].
- idectrl: words 57/58 of IDENTIFY DEVICE are total sectors, not sectors per track [R. Belmont].
- sp0256.c [Wilbert Pol]:
  * Added a little delay before settling LRQ when resetting the device. Fixes MT05103.
  * When reading the LRQ signal, force an update of the stream. This fixes support for 'The Voice' in 'Turtles' for the odyssey2.
- arcadia.c: Verified and corrected ROM names for 'Arcadia Leader Board v2.4' [Kevin Eshbach].
- h8: PC and CCR are packed into one longword. Fixes coinmvga games [O. Galibert, R. Belmont].
- Split saturn and stv up a bit more so that stvprot.c is not linked into MESS [smf].
- Split mame/drivers/saturn.c into emu/machine/saturn.c and mess/drivers/saturn.c, so mame doesn't have to compile and link the unused code [smf].
- emuopts.c: Re-evaluate slot options after loading .ini files [Wilbert Pol].
- Ethernet: Make pcap work on Mac OS X & disable unnecessary packet filtering [Rob Braun].
- Fixed SLEEP opcode in non-DRC SH-2 [Angelo Salese].

- 53c7xx: Preliminary save state support [A. Viloria].
- Add dumped C68 program for 'Steel Gunner 2' [Guru].

- Chihiro.c [Samuele Zannoli]:
  * Implentation of nvidia register combiners.
  * Fix for ide_controller_device class for most uninitialized variables.
- tms57002 works in unidasm, disassemble interface can be revisited when all cpu cores have been converted [smf].
- cps1.c [Team CPS-1]:
  * Documented several games which have roms that have one a 1-byte difference, now known to be confirmed good and simply an older revision. Thanks goto Bonky0013, Kold666, Stefan Lindberg and others for the cooperation and board investigations.
  * Restored back the ROM parts removed in previous updates because they needed to be documented and added the missing ones of the recently dumped 3wondersr1.
- cps1.c: Improved operation of sf2m3, sf2m8, sgyxz [Robbbert].
- g65816.c: Added missing mirror of the 5a22 regs [Fabio Priuli].

- turbo.c: Corrected ROM labels and locations for 'Buck Rogers' and clones [Phil Bennett, Andy Welburn].
- Windows OSD/stdout/stderr output buffering [qmc2].
- m740 updates [R. Belmont]:
  * Added JMP (zp) instruction.
  * Working interrupts.
  * Moved 6502 family V line to make room for up to 16 IRQs.

- m3745x: Preliminary support for the Mitsubishi M37450 microcontroller [R. Belmont].
- gunpey.c: Significant emulation improvements to the emulation bringing the game to a mostly playable state, albeit without decompression of the compressed graphics (scheme still not understood) [Angelo Salese, David Haywood].
- deco_mlc.c: Rewrote video renderer to be scanline based, allowing for further progress on Stadium Hero '96 emulation (it became possible to implement raster interrupt scanline effects without crippling the performance). The game is now mostly playable but there are some outstanding issues likely to be related to the protection [David Haywood].
