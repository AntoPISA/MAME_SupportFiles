Source changes:
---------------
- Rewrote IOX key matrix device implementation, used by Super Real Mahjong Part 2/3 [Angelo Salese].
- Removed ROM patches and added working player 2 inputs in Super Real Mahjong Part 3 [Angelo Salese].
- Fix compiling on GCC 4.6 prerelease [Belegdol].
- Added information screen output for any game known to have bad or missing data in order to better inform the user as to the reason their emulation may not work as expected [Alex Jackson].
- Removed ROM patch in Super Real Mahjong Part 2 [Angelo Salese].
- Cleaned up iox implementation in Speed Attack [Angelo Salese].
- Rewritten Speed Attack video routines from scratch, also fixed screen flipping in it [Angelo Salese].
- Define new macro ALLOW_SAVE_TYPE which can be used to declare enums as valid save types on a case-by-case basis. Updated the cosmac CPU core to do this for its mode and state enums, which were previously failing [Aaron Giles].
- Added a new sound device: Oki MSM9810 [Andrew Gardner]:
  * Added and hooked up volume table.
  * Added preliminary ADPCM2 support.
  * Added sub-table lookups.
  * Added OPT command.
  * Implemented on-chip interpolation & status read.
  * Implemented PAN command and stereo mixing.
- destroyr.c driver minor improvements [hap]:
  * Proper addressmap masks.
  * Added 30132-01.k4 rom, duplicate of 30132-01.f4.

- ksys573, naomi: Device-ify the security flashes and the dallas id chip [Olivier Galibert].
- Fix the interpolation coefficient shifts for the tms5xxx chips based on results of simulating the circuit from the patent [Lord Nightmare].
- mame_file is now emu_file and is a class. It is required to pass a core_options object to the constructor, along with a search path. This required pushing either a running_machine or a core_options through some code that wasn't previously ready to handle it. emu_files can be reused over multiple open/close sessions, and a lot of core code cleaned up nicely as things were converted to them [Aaron Giles].
- Created a file_enumerator class for iterating over files in a searchpath. This replaces the old mame_openpath functions [Aaron Giles].
- Changed machine->options() to return a reference [Aaron Giles].
- Removed public nvram_open() and fixed jchan/kaneko16 to stop directly saving NVRAM [Aaron Giles].
- Removed mame_options() calls; options can only be queried from the running_machine, or by passing them along [Aaron Giles].

- cdrom.h: Added alt lba_to_msf conversion needed by SegaCD/MegaCD [David Haywood].
- Replaced PSX SPU with a much more complete implementation [pSXAuthor, R. Belmont].
- Eliminated global/static variables in a number of Konami/Sega drivers by introducing/using driver_device classes [Atari Ace].
- Eliminated global/static variables in a aristocr/atlus/bfm/bmc/, capcom/cinemat/dataeast drivers by introducing/using driver_device classes [Atari Ace].

- Added HD6301 subtype to the M6800 CPU core [Curt Coder].
- Delete symbols file if defined when invoking clean target [Curt Coder].
- Used the common MC68901 device in micro3d.c [Curt Coder].
- salarymc: CD redumped [Roberto Malone, Yohji, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union].
- sigmab98: Added preliminary sound to the Sammy medal games [Andrew Gardner].
- tms9928a.c: Fixed colors in multicolor mode [Michael Zapf].
- i386: Changed READ/WRITEPORT macros to inline functions to properly support aligned vs. unaligned writes. Fixes regressions in MESS for all drivers using the PCI bus and possibly others [Dirk Best].
- Input ports can now be added to device, names are formed as sub tags from parent device tag [Miodrag Milanovic].
- OKI MSM9810: Added preliminary ADPCM2 support [Andrew Gardner, Lord Nightmare].
- PSX: Add DMA mode used for CD transfers on home system, fix DMA bug that caused home system to freeze [pSXAuthor, Harmony, R. Belmont].
- Hash generation and general cleanup. New class hash_collection holds and manages a collection of hashes, and can be built from an internal format string which is stored with each ROM. Also compacted the form of the hash strings used for ROMs, and fixed verification/hashing of non-ZIPped files [Aaron Giles].
- snes_snd.c: Fixed save state error [Fabio Priuli].
- circus.c: Improved interrupt handling: circus generates them the same way as ripcord (based on sprite-bg collision), robotbwl doesn't generate interrupts at all [hap].
- Updated DIPS and DIP Locations based on documents posted by Laschek at KLOV [Tafoid].
- SDL: GLSL now works for all pixel formats; fixed memory leak on textures [cgwg].
- Eliminate statics/globals in drivers jpm/kaneko/maygay/meadows/merit/metro/midcoin/midw8080/midway/msx/namco [Atari Ace].
- Convert dooyong/edevices/eolith/exidy/gaelco/gottlieb/igs/itech/jaleco drivers to driver_device [Atari Ace].
- Decoupled some entagled drivers [Atari Ace]:
  * Removed unneeded #include lines (gal3.c galaxold.c asic65.c).
  * Split part of the driver include into a separate multi-driver include file (audio/exidy.h audio/exidy440.h audio/wiping.h machine/segag80.h).
  * Moved code to a new file/include to be referenced in multiple drivers (ms32crpt.[ch] opwolf.c rainbow.c).
  * Duplicated some code (palette related) between drivers (mainsnk rollrace sslam).
  * Moved a driver specific routine to a generic device file (atarimo).
  * Cleaned up a few include files (cubocd32 cidelsa metalmx seicross thoop2).

- Fix disassembler override hook [Aaron Giles].
- Fix reads for 32-bit handlers on 64-bit CPUs too [R. Belmont].
- Amiga fixes [Roberto Zandonà]:
  * Removed additional 2 cycles, in move operation, for non-Agnus registers.
  * Set to #0 the start cycle in the copper operation.
- PSX updates [smf]:
  * Fixed DICR handling.
  * Removed non existant root counter 3 IRQ.
  * Ignore root counter stop when reset is also set.
  * Removed custom root counters in Konami 573 driver.
- DS2401: Fixed timer intervals [smf].
- Correct background color in Rougien [Angelo Salese].
- M680x0 updates [Hans Ostermeyer]:

      MCFG_VIDEO_UPDATE -> MCFG_SCREEN_UPDATE 
      MCFG_VIDEO_EOF -> MCFG_SCREEN_EOF
