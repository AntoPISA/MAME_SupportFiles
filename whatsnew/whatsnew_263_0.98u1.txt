Source changes:
---------------
- Changed how perodic timers are defined. Previously, you would specify a number which was interpreted either as Hz (if less than 50000) or as nanoseconds (if greater than 50000). Now, the time is specified as a period and you use the standard TIME_IN_HZ or TIME_IN_NS macros [Aaron Giles].
- Turned on address error checking in the 68000 core. This slows things down a bit but is more accurate and allows correct behavior of a couple of badly-programmed games [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed several issues with address error checking in the 68000 core [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed 68000 bug that treated 8-bit branches with $FF offsets as illegal, rather than allowing them and generating an address error [Aaron Giles].
- Created a new header file mamecore.h, which contains the core common useful macros and typedefs that were scattered throughout the header files. Also added endian swapping macros from MESS [Aaron Giles].
- Fully deprecated the use of cpu_setbank(), which was long ago replaced with memory_set_bankptr() [Aaron Giles].
- Did some major cleanup on the MCR drivers [Aaron Giles]:
  * Implemented Super Sound I/O interrupts properly.
  * Filled out all memory maps according to schematics.
  * Fixed sound sync with various sound boards, allowing for kludges to be removed from 'Power Drive' and 'Star Guards'.
  * Re-verified all connections from wiring diagrams.
  * Documented various lamp and driver boards from the games.
- Some makefile tweaks to hopefully catch variable declaration problems that kept creeping into builds. Switched gcc compiler standard to gnu89 [Atari Ace].
- Removed usage of dirent.h APIs on Windows builds [Atari Ace].
- Corrected resolution to 256x256 in 'Stagger I', 'Red Hawk', 'Sen Jin - Guardian Storm'. All other games still have old visible area that is correct for them [Mamesick].
- Fixed crash in Volfied and 'Operation Wolf' due to improper timer usage [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed one of the TC360 sprite blending modes (used in 'Pulirula round 2' and 'Liquids Kids' attract mode) [Bryan McPhail].
- Fixed sprite/tilemap placement in 'Legend of Kage' [Phil Stroffolino].
- PowerPC core update [Nathan Woods]:
  * Added infrastructure to generate DSI and ISI exceptions.
  * Made the lbz/lbzu/lbzux/lbzx instructions properly clear out the high 24 bits in the results.
  * Added SRR0 and SRR1 to the debug view.
- Did some cleanups in the vamphalf.c driver [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed speedbal again, after breaking it in the last update [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Changed 'Nitro Ball' to use the new deco16_tilemap_34_combine_draw function Bryan added some time ago [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added a sprite wrap around needed in 'Riot level 2' [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Added sound to 'Dragon Bowl' [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
