Source changes:
---------------
Updated TMS5220 core to use shifts instead of divides for the 
parameter interpolation. Also added support for internal clamping to
8-bit output when using the internal DAC [Lord Nightmare].

Fixed regression that caused CHD games to crash if the CHD was not
present. Also fixed change that required write access to CHDs [smf].

Fixed CHD search paths again so that they look in parent 
subdirectories. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed security cassette contents to get Guitar Freaks 3rd Mix 
(GE949 VER. JAB) in game [smf].

Exposed core_vfprintf(), and implemented mame_vfprintf() in terms of 
that call [Nathan Woods].

Some improvements to the Wheels + Fire driver. Still not right.
[David Haywood]

Added SCSIOP_GET_INQUIRY_BUFFER to scsicd & scsihd [smf].

MB86233 core changes: [ElSemi]
 * fixed a double move opcode
 * added a previously unknown double move opcode

Changed the way MAME handles options internally. Changed 
mame_options_init() to return a core_options object, which is now 
passed into mame_execute(). Moved mame_options() to mame.c, which is 
now only valid while the emulation is running. Audit functions now 
take a core_options parameter [Nathan Woods].

More HD6309 fixes [Tim Lindner]:
 * the SEXW instruction not longer clears the overflow flag
 * now generating an illegal instruction trap if invalid registers
    specified for TFM

- Changed Windows message filtering to only apply to MAME game windows [Nathan Woods].
- Made a cleanup pass through the new x86emit.h code emitters, changing the way memory is referenced and replacing macros with inline functions [Aaron Giles].
- Updated MIPS and PowerPC drc cores to use the new emitters. Removed the old macro-based ones in x86drc.h [Aaron Giles].
-Added save state support to pacland [Aaron Giles].
-Made -autoframeskip aware of the -speed setting [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed stack buffer overrun in install_mem_handler() that broke the Hyperstone-based games under gcc 4.2.1 [Aaron Giles]
