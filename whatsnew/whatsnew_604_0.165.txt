-vidbrain.xml: Added Information Manager prototype [Sean Riddle].

-Add correct CD2802 chirp ROM from decap [Sean Riddle]

-mk4: Add rudimentary blending. [MooglyGuy]

-utf8 support for pstring. Opted for a scalable solution which should
	be easily extensible to utf16 and utf32 as well. All position related
	operations now operate on char code positions instead of byte
	positions [Couriersud].

-chihiro.c: Move parts common with Xbox console into their own files
	machine/xbox.c and includes/xbox.h [Samuele Zannoli]

-gei.c: Minor Clean up [Brian Troha]

	Chihiro [Samuele Zannoli]

-Add support for M58819 'VSM-emulator', fixes speech in Radar Scope
	TRS01 set [Lord Nightmare].

-Replaced the frame parse and speech generation code from tms5110.c
	with the code from tms5220.c, should be significantly more accurate
	and allow the cores to be much more easily merged in the future. This
	also allowed finally getting rid of the COEFF_ENERGY_SENTINEL hack in
	tms5110r.inc. [Lord Nightmare].

-deco32.c: Verified and corrected the ROM labels for the Fighter's
	History (World ver 43-07, DE-0380-2 PCB) set. [Charles MacDonald]

Implemented proper ZPAR and unvoiced ZPAR logic for zeroing parameters during idle and unvoiced frames. Changed the pitch zeroing logic during frame inhibit to last an entire interpolation period rather than one sample. Replaced the speech-is-synthesizing state machine with the original patent TALK, TALKD and SPEN bits. Redid the talk_status logic to use (TALKD || SPEN) as the real device does. [Lord Nightmare].

- pet_rom.xml: Added Edex (France, v4.4) [Hervé Warin].
