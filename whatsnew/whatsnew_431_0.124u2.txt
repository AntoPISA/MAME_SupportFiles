Source changes:
---------------
- Changed the system to show a message if coin-lockout is active and a coin key is pressed [Couriersud].
- Actually fixed -refreshspeed [Aaron Giles].
- Reverted previous SCSI CD change which broke some games [R. Belmont].
- Seibu COP cleanup, primarily sorting the code and identifying similarities in different implementations [David Haywood].
- Fixed an erroneous debug change which leaked into the last version of the namcona1 update [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed marineb colors [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina].
- Rewrote INP recording from scratch, since all old INPs are broken anyways. Header now includes timestamp, which overrides the default time base for MAME's system time. Each frame recorded now gets a timestamp. Analog ports are recorded once per frame and interpolated. Analog port calculations are all done in fixed point for consistent results. A bunch of other minor tweaks in the input port code. NOTE: There may still be a few changes to the final INP format [Aaron Giles].
- Improved graphic decoding for Legionnaire, the BK3 tiles are now correctly extracted from the TXT region, map screen has correct tiles now [David Haywood].
- Removed CPS1 tile kludges and replaced with per-game ROM mapping tables. Ideally, the ROM mapping should be derived from mapping of the PALs found on the B board. Note that this is a significant change and some new bugs might be caused by it. Unlike previous bugs, where extra garbage tiles would appear in the games, the new bugs would be tiles or sprites MISSING--so they will be harder to notice.
- This would happen because in some cases the 16x16 regions of the GFX ROMs can be used by both scroll2 and sprites, while in other cases they must be separated [Nicola Salmoria].
- PSX updates [smf]:
  * Fixed the SR masks for MTC0.
  * Added ability to test the instruction/data cache ram. The scratchpad and BIU register are now handled internally to the CPU.
  * All writes are performed with masks. SWL/SWR used to be implemented with two writes ( one byte and one word ) when writing three bytes, now it only ever performs one. Byte and Word writes use masks as they leave the rest of the register on the bus, which can be  picked up by larger registers.
  * The read/write functions to use are cached when the SR bits are updated, as are the bad address masks.
  * Added coprocessor 1 & 3 support, though they don't do anything useful.
  * All loads now go through the delay pipeline, a lwl/lwr will grab the value out of the pipeline if it's updating the same register.
  * Added undocumented behaviour of BLEZ/BGTZ. The comparison for zero can be changed by specifying an alternate register in the RT field (the documentation says you should always use register 0).
  * Restricted to 16 COP0 registers & generate an exception if any of the 5 for the MMU are used.
  * Added BCF/BCT instructions, although I have found no conditions that affect them yet.
  * Generates an exception if any MMU instructions are executed.
  * Sets the CE instruction for all exceptions, not just those involving a coprocessor. The bits of the opcode that specify the coprocessor are grabbed no matter what the instruction.
  * Added TAR register and BT bit in SR. When an exception occurs during a branch, BT determines whether it was taken or not. The TAR register gets set to the destination of the branch.
  * Fixed the BD bit when you are in a branch delay slot and you didn't take the branch, this shows up in the pipeline as !pc.
  * Fixed branches within a branch delay slot.
  * Multiply & divide instructions can be aborted if you write to HI/LO before reading the result. Added data breakpoints, you don't appear to be able to set breakpoints on any of the  addresses internal to the CPU.
  * Multiply/divide/GTE instructions can execute when an exception is taken, although the EPC indicates that it hasn't. The BIOS avoids rerunning GTE instructions as they are destructive, so you have to make sure they run.
  * Added bus error handling, PSXCPU is limited to 8mb of RAM & any access outside this range will trigger an exception. I believe this is to be an internal limit.
  * Added CXD8611R as a specific CPU type, System 12 appears to allow more than 8mb of RAM & it's possible that this is different.
  * Mapped out all instructions to either generate an exception or ignore bits.
  * Updated the disassembler to match the decoding.
  * Fixed disassembling of branch instructions in a branch delay slot.
  * Lui checks for a ori/addiu following and will show you the result.
  * Added step over/out support.
  * Fixed standalone disassembler.
  * Fixed SZ0 truncation.
  * Fixed IRGB truncation and conversion to IR1/IR2/IR3.
  * Added IR1/IR2/IR3 saturation when calculating ORGB.
  * Fixed OTZ sign extension.
  * Fixed reading from SXYP.
  * Fixed reading from IRGB.
  * Fixed writing to LZCR.
  * Fixed sign extension of GTE control registers.
  * Fixed writing to FLAG.
  * Fixed flag calculation in F macro.
  * l Fixed avsz3 & avsz4 flag & otz calculation.
- Fixed unicode crashing bug with input names [Aaron Giles].
- Renamed input port functions [Aaron Giles]:

  readinputport           -> input_port_read_indexed
  readinputportbytag      -> input_port_read 
  readinputportbytag_safe -> input_port_read_safe.

- Bulk converted drivers explicitly calling input_port_n_r() with a bogus offset to calling input_port_read_indexed() instead [Aaron Giles].
- Memory map merges for drivers starting with U, V, W, and Z [Andrew Gardner].
- Mostly fixed sound in N64-based games [Adam Gashlin].
- Correct DMA functionality in N64-based games [Ville Linde].
- Aerfboot improvements [robiza]:
  * Sprite offset are now correct.
  * Split spriteram in two parts.
  * Identified last sprite for the two parts.
  * Promoted to "working" (no sound).
- Pallavol improvements [robiza]:
  * Fix for sprite's y-coordinate.
  * Implement lookup table for convert sprite code in the real code.
  * Change the name to "1991 Spikes (Italian bootleg)".
  * Fix scroll.
  * Fix offset.
- Merged sonson memory maps [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added mising TC0060DCA sound mixer to the Taito Z driver. Marked one dblaxle ROM as BAD_DUMP [Nicola Salmoria].
- Changed the 8237dma implementation into a device [Wilbert Pol].
- Fixed wrong tile-sprite priority in m62 driver [robiza].
- Fixed nec v30 dasm when a "real-time encrypted cpu" is used. Also fixed Execution Clocks for add,addc,and,or,xor,cmp,sub,subc instructions [robiza].
- Removed the hardcoded dependency on a 8254 device from the 8042kbdc code. Changed the drivers using the 8042kdbc to define their own 8042kdbc - 8254 dependency [Wilbert Pol].
- Rewrote core memory handlers as inline functions. These should be easier to trace through in a debug build, yet should operate the same as before [Aaron Giles].
- Created a complete set of functions for all databus sizes (8,16,32,64) and all endiannesses. A few functions are redundant, but it is now very clear which functions to use in which scenarios. It is also now possible to rely on being able to access values of 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits via the built-in accessors without fear of crashing [Aaron Giles].
- Updated all cores using 8-bit handlers to explicitly call the 8-bit handlers with the appropriate endianness [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed a few games which were calling n-bit handlers directly to use the generic forms. In the future, this is all the access drivers will have [Aaron Giles].
- More opcodes fixed in gussun oyoyo and risky challenge [robiza].
- Added tags and locations to dips for marvins.c and matmania.c [Fabio Priuli].
- Enabled roz tilemap in emeraldia, but it's not centered in the right position when it's not in its original dimension [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed 'lghost*' DIP Switches [stephh].
- Reduced the number of save state callback types from 3 to 1. The only remaining form is the one that takes a pointer parameter. Added macros for STATE_PRESAVE and STATE_POSTLOAD to define common functions. Added machine parameter to these functions. Updated all drivers and CPU/Sound cores  to use the new macros and consolidate on the single function type. As a result pushed the machine parameter through a few initialization stacks [Aaron Giles].
- Removed unnecessary postload callbacks which only marked all tiles dirty, since this is done automatically by the tilemap engine [Aaron Giles].
- Updates for the driver wc90b.c [ClawGrip]:
  * Removed the second YM2203, it isn't present on the bootleg boards.
  * Changed the clocks according to the oscilators found on the board.
- Added the running_machine* parameter to the function passed into cpunum_set_irq_callback() and adds the IRQ_CALLBACK macro for the callback function [Oliver Stoenberg].
- Cleaned up the Machine usage in the osd/windows files and added the running_machine parameter where possible [Oliver Stoenberg].
- Various tweaks/fixes [MAMEPlus]:
  * Save state support for FD1094 chips.
  * Improved graphics in athena
  * Improved sound balance in armedf.
  * Derived refresh rate for toaplan1 games.
  * Improved sound balance in tmnt games.
  * Derived clocks for suprridr.
  * Tweaked xmen visible area.
  Derived clocks and refresh rate in twin16 driver.
- CPS1: Verified some gfx ROM mapping tables against PAL dumps. Improved understanding and emulation of palette related registers [Nicola Salmoria, Corrado Tomaselli].
