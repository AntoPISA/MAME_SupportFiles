Source changes:
---------------
- Massive architectural change: There is no longer a single, global palette. Instead, palettes are now devices, and drivers and devices can have as many independent palettes as needed. This update required extensive changes to many parts of the core, UI, OSD layers, drivers and devices [Aaron Giles, Miodrag Milanovic, Alex Jackson].
- Likewise, there is no longer a single, global array of decoded graphics. Decoded graphics are now owned by devices using a new device interface, called, unsurprisingly, device_gfx_interface. A "gfxdecode" device (which does nothing but inherit this interface) provides the old, driver-level decoding functionality for drivers with video emulation not based on devices and for devices that haven't been updated to the new interface (which is currently most of them). Also, graphics layouts can now reference shared RAM regions by tag the same way as ROM regions, eliminating the need to set up RAM-based graphics manually (note that drivers/devices are still responsible for marking gfx elements dirty when the RAM they are decoded from is written to) [Miodrag Milanovic, Alex Jackson].
- Huge effort has been done in order to modernize core and drivers, almost
 every file has been touched [Curt Coder, Osso, Alex Jackson, smf, Miodrag Milanovic].
- Fixed a bug preventing memory display of INT8/UINT8 in debugger [Couriersud].
- Added missing interfaces to netlist. mame -debug pongf now does not crash any longer and displays some state. Still more work needed. Further improved the netlist state saving [Couriersud].
- tx0.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- Removed legacy code in netlist and separated out 74153 and 74107(A) [Couriersud].
- superfx.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- Truco-Tron: Reversed and documented almost all PCB's ICs [Roberto Fresca].
- Added a "-u" (for unix) flag to srcclean to produce unix-style endings [Couriersud].
- spc700.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- Added a dry-run option (-d) to srcclean. Know what you are doing :-) [Couriersud].
- mc68901.c: Use aer register to select which transition to generate an interrupt on and added preliminary transmit and receive support [smf].
- se3208.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- Alignment of netlist with MAME standards. Inputs to netlist are now registered using by MCFG_* as MAME subdevices and exhibit the usual writeXX/readXX methods including a PORT_CHANGED method. This allows direct linking to inputs [Couriersud].
- sc61860.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- ssp1601.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- diserial.c: Don't transmit anything when driven by an external clock and nothing has been queued. call set_data_frame() before calling set_rcv_rate() as otherwise it acccesses m_synchronous before it is set leading to random behaviour. Changed parity & stop bits to an enum (you can now pass in 1.5). Updated the uarts that were testing for 1.5 stop bits to pass that in, but there are probably others & 1.5 stop bits is converted to 2 by diserial. The 68681 requires stop bits to be specified in clocks, so this will change in the future. Replaced synchronous flag with start bit count, as some uarts can use a start bit in synchronous mode & that whether there is a start bit is all the flag is currently controlling. Updated rs232 terminal to allow startbits, stop bits 1.5 to be specified (although that is currently not supported by diserial) and individual transmit and receive baud rates [smf].
- scmp.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- atarist.c: Push all gpio values to allow interrupts to work [smf].
- unsp.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- AVR8 improvements [Felipe Sanches]:
  * Added ELPM instructions.
  * Added fuse bits macros.
  * Added reset logic to decide initial program counter based on fuse bits configuration.
  * Added initial support for ATMEGA1280 and ATMEGA2560.
  * Use register names in the disassembly of IN and OUT instructions.
- tms32010.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- segaorun.c: Added motor and lamp outputs [Howard Casto, hap].
- via6522.c: Converted to use devcb2. Removed alot of read handlers where the values could more easily (and often were being) pushed. CA1 is input only, so I have removed the output callback. The lisa via hookup has been changed as it had functions named as CA2/CB2 hooked up to CA1/CB1 and CA1 output no longer exists, it appears to have been wrong since before the code was merged with MAME. Added support for shift out free running at t2 rate, cb1 output now lasts for the specified number of clocks and the signal goes low at the end [smf].
- tms32025.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- Enhanced the netlist parser and cleaned pong.c. Also added a folder nl_examples which contains standalone netlist examples. [Couriersud].

- Netlist [Couriersud]:
  * Fixed 7474 save state.
  * Remove a printf.
  * Simplified netlist_list_t.
  * Increased reschedule count to 15 - diodes are dog-slow.
  * Made reschedule count a solver parameter.
  * Simplified solver code.
  * Solver time now also resets.
- fd_fdc: Fix the FM sync detection [Michael Zapf].
- n68681: Modernized and killed config struct in favor of devcb2 [R. Belmont].
- Fix for pixel gaps between multi-screen games in HLSL mode [MooglyGuy].
- Merged pet/vic20/c64/plus4/c128 user ports, the pinout is slightly different on each one but there are cards that are compatible with each of the different machines. Removed c64 version of vic1011 and moved protovision 4 player adapter from bus/c64 to bus/vic20. Tested with http://code.google.com/p/commodore-multi-player/ [smf].
- Hooked up the 6551 to the plus 4 user port [smf].

- Converted PIA6821 to DEVCB2, Removed porta_r/portb_r/ca1_r/ca2_r/cb1_r/cb2_r functions as they only returned what you'd written to the chip, only a couple of those were ever used (by audio/exidy.c). Removed some ca*/cb* read callbacks that just returned what had already been pushed or always returned 0. As there are no longer any cb2 read callbacks that functionality has been removed. reduced the number of callers to set_a_input by calling porta_w & made the WRITE8_HANDLER call that as well, instead of the other way round and having to lookup an address space that is never used [smf].
- Netlist [Couriersud]:
  * Added Ebers-Moll BJT model. Currently only for NPN.
  * Fixed convergence issue in the solver.
  * Accuracy for Ebers-Moll must be better than 1e-5 to not generate nano-second spikes. Typical sound applications should be able to run with less since the spikes are not audible.
- tlcs90.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- Removed calls to mpu4_state *state = machine.driver_data<mpu4_state>(); by moving code into mpu4_state. Removed runtime lookup of devices that were already looked up in mpu4_state [smf].

- v810.c: Modernized CPU core.  [Wilbert Pol].
- s2650.c: Replaced FLAG fake IO port with a DEVCB2 callback. Added write_sense method and use it for pipbug serial port, Hunchback (Galaxian Hardware) and replace calls to set_input_line(1 in lazercmd.c & meadows.c [smf].
- exp85.c: Added an RS232 port instead of hard coding the serial terminal [smf].
- Added preliminary sound to thunderlbl. Unsurprisingly seems to share the same hook-up as wiggie and superbon, the other thunderl hacks in the driver. Marked as IMPERFECT_SOUND cause the music keeps restarting after a few seconds after inserting a coin. Seems fine during gameplay, though [Osso].
- Fixed compiling with Visual Studio 2012 [smf].

- isbc.c: Converted to use RS232 port instead of hard coded to using serial terminal [smf].
- Removed some dead code and ambiguous functions in the netlist code [Couriersud].
- Introduced the concept of "logic families". Currently, standard devices default to TTL. Going forward, this enables the family type (e.g. LS, S, HCT, ...) to be a device parameter. Currently, no changes are introduced. This is architecture work [Couriersud].
- Created a mame sound device for netlist. Fixed an issue causing wild oscillations. Currently, pong has sample code for using the sound device. Uncomment "TEST_SOUND" in pong.c to hear a constant sound from a 7400 multivibrator. Sound is still WIP, but the proof of concept has been done [Couriersud].
- Added music and save states to bmcbowl [Osso].

- z80.c: Converted c++ [smf].
- ata/ide: Added support for 8 bit data transfers using the set features command, instead of using mem_mask as ATA doesn't work that way [smf].
- Replaced some calls to machine().firstcpu with m_maincpu [smf].
- Replaced some calls to machine().firstcpu->pcbase() with machine().describe_context() [smf].
- bankdev.c: Don't change the current bank on reset, because another device might have already changed the bank when it was reset [smf].
- clcd.c: Implemented MMU making it usable. Hooked up rtc, rs232, centronics and sound. LCD colors are matched up from this photograph http://vivaamigafilm.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/chillin-with-porter.html. The character ROM is not dumped http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/ckb/secret/cbm-vlcd-charrom.jpg. So a fake font is used which takes the unused upper case font in the kernel ROM as a starting point and adds lower case characters, trying to make them match the available screen shots http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/ckb/secret/cbm-lcd-screen.gif. There appears to be several bugs in the roms that affect the rtc [smf].
- Added unknown encrypted Royal Card. This game is running on Dino 4 encrypted hardware, with a CPU+PLCC daughterboard. Decrypted program address + data, but code still jumps into $48xx range where there's no valid code. Decoded and partially decrypted the graphics set [Roberto Fresca, ANY].
- n68681: make loopback operate at the current baud rate instead of instantaneously. Fixes dectalk DUART self-test [R. Belmont].
- z180.c: Modernized CPU core [Wilbert Pol].
- tourvis.c: Correct 1 cart name and add newly dumped U4-43 BIOS [The Dumping Union].
- Converted MSM58321 to DEVCB2, uses level logic rather than edge detection for strobes (as per datasheet), added NVRAM interface as there are some configuration bits to save, added support for 12 and 24 hour. It defaults to 12 hour, but you can configure it in the driver to default to 24H. You can configure what year 0 is in the driver, which is used when setting the date at startup [smf].
- sharc.c: Modernized cpu core.  [Wilbert Pol].
- Added SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS to Express Raider, fixed screen size to 256x240 [Angelo Salese].

  * Fixed konamigt layout aspect ratio.
  * Some corrections to address maps and inputs.
- popeye.c: Added RC filter (MT 3726), cleanups [Alex Jackson].
-Stop the flipping insanity: Tilemap flipping is now calculated relative to the center of the visible area rather than to the total screen size, and the generic flip screen functions no longer modify the visible area. These changes ensure that in most cases flipping should Just Work for drivers that use MCFG_RAW_PARAMs, games that have a programmable CRTC, and games that have raster effects, and should fix many longstanding flip/cocktail-related regressions [Alex Jackson].
- Added Bingo (1983). PCB seems bootleg, but the game looks legit. Worked from the scratch a whole set of inputs and button-lamps support for this game. Changed the poker41 description to Four in One Poker (as seen in the official brochure). Added game and technical notes [Roberto Fresca].

FM-7 parallel port joystick works again. Added support for using PC LPT control lines as inputs (not tested). c64 geocable now just passes individual lines through, changed the strobe line to what is documented online (not tested). Converted MSX & exidy sorcerer parallel port DAC to use covox device instead of using a configuration switch (not tested). Sorcerer parallel port is more like the commodore user port, so should be converted to it's own slot where one option is a centronics card [smf].
- Magic Card II: Override the wrong visible area and centered the game through a dedicated CRTC config interface [Roberto Fresca].
- Converted SN76496 ready to DEVCB2 [smf].

- Added generic barcode reader emulation: The code accepts sequences of digits in UPC-A, EAN-13 and EAN-8 format, stores them in both byte format and in pixel format; it is up to the driver to implement the correct transfer protocol [Fabio Priuli].
- Added UI menu to enter barcodes via keyboard. It only gets activated if the running machine has a barcode device [Fabio Priuli].
- Truco-Tron: Identified the last unknown IC (U15). Added Technical
 notes [Cristian Arias, Roberto Fresca].
- diimage: Added "read_only" feature to the software list to denote write protected images [Curt Coder].

- Funworld driver updates [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Added Luna Park (set 1, dual program). Running in modified CMC hardware, with video RAM 4000-4FFF mirrored in 6000-6FFF and color RAM 5000-5FFF mirrored in 7000-7FFF. This game has the highest address line of the program tied to DIP switch #1, so you can select between 2 different programs. Both programs write to videoram either to each video RAM ranges.

- Add an osd_truncate call to truncate files [O. Galibert].
- Moved core template container classes up from emutempl.h to coretmpl.h [Aaron Giles]:
  * These classes now no longer take a resource_pool; everything is managed globally -- this means that objects added to lists must be allocated with global_alloc.
  * Added new auto_pointer<> template which wraps a pointer and auto-frees it upon destruction; it also defaults to NULL so it doesn't need to be explicitly initialized.
  * Moved tagged_list template to tagmap.h.
- Redo of the low-level memory tracking system [Aaron Giles]:
  * Moved low-level tracking out of emu\emualloc into lib\util\corealloc so it can be shared among all components and used by core libraries.
  * Global_alloc and friends no longer use a resource pool to track allocations; turns out this was a wholly redundant system that wasted a lot of memory.
  * Removed global_resource_pool entirely.
  * Added global_free_array to delete arrays allocated with global_alloc_array.
  * Added tracking of object versus array allocation; we will now error if you use global_free on an array, or global_free_array on an object.
- Added new utility helper const_string_pool which can be used to efficiently accumulate strings that are not intended to be modified. Used by updated makelist and software list code [Aaron Giles].
- Updated png2bdc and makelist tools to not leak memory and use more modern techniques (no more MAX_DRIVERS in makelist, for example) [Aaron Giles].
- Deprecated auto_strdup and removed all uses by way of caller-managed astrings and the software list rewrite [Aaron Giles].
- Rewrote software list management [Aaron Giles]:
  * Removed the notion of a software_list that is separate from a software_list_device; they are one and the same now.
  * Moved several functions into device_image_interface since they really didn't belong in the core software list class.
  * Lots of simplification as a result of the above changes.

- offtwall.c: Corrected the ROM names and locations of the upright version of Atari's Off the Wall and also added a dump of one of the GAL's (a GAL16V8A-25LP) on the boardset which was the only one without the security fuse blown [Kevin Eshbach].
- upd765: Refactored to use devcb2 callbacks [Curt Coder].
- Made gfx_element::decode() private; fixed drivers that were calling it directly [Alex Jackson].
- Added proper IC locations to tmnt2 sets [Ben76].
- Added Korean? tile ROM to newly dumped Shanghai3 set [Brian Troha] (was present on the board, but unused in our sets? probably for use with undumped Korean program roms and leftover from conversion).
- h63484.c compile fix [external].
- Added compile time check for 64-bit intel compiler to delegate.h (to prevent assert(sizeof(mfp) <= sizeof(m_rawdata)); ) [external].
- Made an attempt to fix the banking of MPU4 games, this isn't perfect, but most non banked games will now run [J. Wallace].
- SDL: Removed "totalColors" hack, now only RGB32 is sent to the GPU [R. Belmont].
- littlerb.c: Fill in missing dipswitch settings and add dipswitch locations to Little Robin [Brian Troha].
- SDL: Next stage cleanup, aligned texture conversion with current Windows/D3D code, and fixed overzealous GL texture caching [R. Belmont].
- tms5110r.inc: Updated tms5110 to use newer chirp table, based on decap [Lord_Nightmare, digshadow].
- 315_5124.c: Improved X-Scroll register timing [Enik Land].
- netlist: Nice performance increase by removing logic terminals from net if they are inactive. Introduced a linked-list class to abstract linked-lists. Fixed deactivating devices. You have to enable this because it is not guaranteed to be timing-exact [Couriersud].
- N64 RSP changes [MooglyGuy]:
  * Added SIMUL_SIMD flag for easy finding of bugs in SIMD opcodes.
  * Fixed SIMD versions of SSV, SLV, SDV, STV, VSUB, VADDC, VSUBC, and VGE.
  * Removed SIMD optimizations from VMACF, VMADL, VMADN, as they were provided by the CEN64 author but do not appear to have the same results as MESS's scalar implementations, and so are not trustworthy.
- h8: Rewrite [O. Galibert].
- Updated MegaPlay and MegaTech to use modern SMS VDP [Fabio Priuli].
- Fixes to correct some of the regression test data used by the jedutil test [Kevin Eshbach].
- h8: dec16/inc16 fix [Fabio Priuli].
- h8: Sort out UE polarity. Fix enable handling in timers. Prettify registers/flags in debugger [O. Galibert]
- floppy: Splice-related fixes [O. Galibert].
- Improvements to 4enlinea driver. Hooked preliminary HCGA controller in CGA mode (we need proper UM487F device emulation). Added documentation and findings after some analysis [Roberto Fresca].
- gfx_elements now have a xor mask that is applied to each source bit offset when decoding. This can be used to deal with endianness when decoding gfx from RAM or from program ROMs, or to reverse the bit order sense when this is useful (e.g. pgm.c) [Alex Jackson].
- mc6845: Added display enable and horizontal/vertical back porch widths to the update function. Updated some MESS drivers to make use of this [Curt Coder].
- 4enlinea: Adjusted the initial screen parameters according to the HCGA controller programmed registers and improved the way the graphics are drawn. Now the text is readable [Roberto Fresca].
- 4enlinea: Hooked a status handler for the HCGA controller (for now, simulating the state). Improved the memory map fixing the RAM amount and offset, and added the correct offset for the HCGA status. Also hooked 2 debug handlers on ports e000-e001 that spit some random graphics after 30 seconds of the game execution (clue to figure out) [Roberto Fresca].
- Naomi updates [MetalliC]:
  * Redumped 17 GD-ROMs from .gdi source to CHD v5.
  * Added several missing protection keys.
  * Added clone "18 Wheeler (Upright)".
  * Added set "Club Kart: European Session (2003)" and unprotected clone.
  * Added clone "Club Kart: European Session [Rev. D]".
- cps1.c: Dumped and added MS22B.1A to mswordj [Bonky0013, neocps1].
- Moved MPU4 Test Program 4 to the MOD4 driver, still needs some work on the timing though. Fixed Gamball reel positioning, this will need more work to standardise [J. Wallace].
- quickjac: added inputs [Sandro Ronco].
- namco23: Spring cleaning, including [O. Galibert]:
  * Remove a bunch of s23 prefixes/suffixes useless since the OOification.
  * Rename p3d to c435.
  * Unify c435 dma and pio.
  * Identify the generic set state command.
  * Implement the interrupt set state subcommand.
  * Fix the endianness of the controls port (controls still don't work though).
  * Various whatevers.
- tiamc1:
  * Background scroll corrected and enabled [MetalliC].
  * Fixed bad graphics ROM in "Snezhnaja Koroleva" [Titus].
- cosmac: Added write line members for the input lines [Curt Coder].
- namcos23: Fix the irq storm that killed Downhill Bikers [O. Galibert].
- Untangled Little Robin sound HW from video timings [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed a long standing bug in tempest by specifying quantum perfect emulation. All save states should be removed since they may contain a corrupted game state [Couriersud].
- namcos23: Fix 3D computations in timecrs2. Better understanding of the command format, downhill and 500gp now show something (completely wrong) [O. Galibert].
- namcos23: Enhance matrix-vector mul [O. Galibert].
- Added support for horizontal 'belt' reels which may be needed for future AWP titles. To invoke, add an attribute "beltreel" to the reel element in the layout, and set it to 1 [J. Wallace].
- h8: Add the h8/3008 [O. Galibert].
- Double Crown: Added button-lamps support, coin in and coin out counters, MAX693 watchdog reset, minor input fixes, and added technical notes [Roberto Fresca].
- Double Crown: Redesigned the button-lamps layout and added support for CANCEL button [Roberto Fresca].
- New Z80 CPU derivate Toshiba TLCS-Z80 [Felipe Sanches].
- Added brightness control to berlwall RGB backgrounds [David Haywood].
- Convert Little Robin to use TMS34010 instead of custom blitter code and share some parts of the implementation with Mega Phoenix [David Haywood].
- TMS34010 core improvements [David Haywood]:
  * Improved 8-bit write handling needed by Mega Phoenix and Little Robin to display all their graphics.
  * Fixed top of screen clipping issue that was causing visible glitches with objects dropping in from the top in the same games.
- Update a number of drivers to use multiple palettes [David Haywood].
- Add deluxe cabinet motor roms to various Sega sets [ANY].
- Add dumped EEPROMs to Jockey Club II sets and attempt to hook up the device allowing initial ID check to pass [ANY].
- Super Star '97: Marked all graphics ROMs as bad dump (they are mask ROMs and were dumped as 27512, missing half of the graphics) [Roberto Fresca].
- Add Zoom ZSG2 sound, used in taitogn and fx1b. DSP isn't hooked up yet, so it will sound a bit tinny [hap].
- goldnpkr.c driver: Inverted and normalize the button-lamps states for all games [Roberto Fresca]..
- Various Atari vector drivers: derive (fake) refresh rate from CPU IRQ frequency to reduce judder [Alex Jackson].
- toaplan1.c: correct SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS for all games based on CRTC registers [Alex Jackson].
- naomi.c: redumped cfield CHD from GDI source, documented PIC used by ngdup23e set [MetalliC].
