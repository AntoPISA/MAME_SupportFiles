Source changes:
---------------
Updated memconv.h to convert from basically any to any widths 
(8/16/32/64), on both little and big endian. Also added macros to 
create the stubs for the most commonly used mappings, both in the 
1:1 fashion, or the LSB/MSB/LSW/MSW style. [Ernesto Corvi]

CuboCD32/Amiga updates: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Finished implementing the CDROM controller, so now the games boot
 - Moved the entire Akiko code to machine/cubocd32.c to make things 
    a little more easier to work with
 - Added CDDA audio support to the CDROM controller and driver
 - Systems with the AGA chipset no longer connect bit 0 of the CIA 
    that was previously connected to the Overlay pin not connected
 - Made BLTDDAT return it's value. This is a readable register which 
    we were not handling.
 - Initialized the SERDATR register upon reset to reflect that the 
    transfer buffer/shift reg is empty.

Added support for the PowerPC 601. [Ville Linde]

Fixed missing PLD region in -listxml [MASH].

Changed all comparison for CPU and sound chip types to compare 
against CPU_DUMMY or SOUND_DUMMY instead of 0. Also updated usages
of sndti_to_sndnum() so that they use sndti_exists() where appropriate.
[Atari Ace]

Removed CHD interface structure. CHDs now rely on the corefile 
routines to perform file I/O. Updated the rest of the system to
handle this reality. A side-effect is that "split" CHDs, which never
got much play, have now been deprecated [Nathan Woods].

Added new core library utility module palette.c for managing palettes.
Renamed emulator-specific palette code to emupal.c and restructured
to live on top of the core library code. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for attaching palettes to bitmaps in the core. Removed
support for the 16-pixel bitmap "safety" zone by default, since most
drivers do not need it. Added new function bitmap_alloc_slop() which
supports creating bitmaps with caller-specified slop values.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed the gfx_element.colortable element and replaced it with a new
element color_base which specifies the global color offset. This
breaks an awkward dependency between the palette and graphics code,
and removes a lot of odd pointer arithmetic in the system. 
[Aaron Giles]

- Tagged Machine->pens, Machine->colortable, and 
Machine->remapped_colortable as const to prevent their abuse. Fixed several abusing drivers, and tagged the remainder for future cleanup [Aaron Giles].
- Added new colortable management functions in emupal.c. These functions can be used to manage a colortable on top of the core palette in cases where TRANSPARENCY_COLOR is currently used (essentially mapping to a pen mask for TRANSPARENCY_PENS). Updated pacman, mappy, toypop, and several other drivers to use the new functions [Aaron Giles].
- Vastly simplified the rendering code in docastle [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed remaining errors and warnings when building under gcc 4.2.1 [Aaron Giles].
- Added new function render_target_set_max_update_rate() which allows
the OSD layer to inform MAME of the target's refresh rate (or 0 if there is no maximum). This is used to allow for the dynamic speed adjustment parameter below [Aaron Giles].
- Added new parameter -refreshspeed (-rs for short) which dynamically adjusts the -speed parameter to keep the effective refresh rate below that of the lowest screen refresh rate [Aaron Giles].
- Added more opcode emitters to x86emit.h [Aaron Giles]
