Source changes:
---------------
- Added board description to Zodiack [Guru].
- Demoted some games to have the GAME_NOT_WORKING flag:
  * Alligator Hunt (protected version);
  * Glass;
  * Great Guns;
  * Name Club Ver. 3;
  * Snow Board Championship;
  * Tetris Korean bootleg;
  * Thunder Hoop 2: TH Strikes Back;
  * Touryuu Densetsu Elan-Doree and Elan Doree - Legend of Dragoon;
  * World Grand Prix;
  * World Rally 2 - Twin Racing.
- Some various Naomi improvements and SH4 hacks to get more Naomi games booting farther [David Haywood, Angelo Salese].
- Added a PCB layout for the large single plane PCB that Incredible Technologies used for the Golden Tee 3D series (3D through Classic), 'Shuffleshot', 'World Class Bowling' and 'World Class Bowling Deluxe' [Guru].
- Added PCB layout & hardwared documentation for Atari's Badlands [Guru].
- WIP driver for Cubo CD32 [Mariusz Wojcieszek]:
  * AGA palette;
  * AGA bitplane data fetching;
  * Support for up to 8 standard bitplanes;
  * HAM8 mode.
- Further annotated the game lists is mamedriv.c [Yasuhiro Ogawa].
- Fixed pending IRQs handling in the TLCS-90 CPU core [Luca Elia].
- Updated video timing in bestbest to match PCB [Guru].
- ejsakura fix: Added ymz280b_r to memory map to prevent musics to stopwhile playing [Cs9ph7Rg0].
- nemesis.c fix [Hau]:
  * Fixed screen priority problems in Kitten Kaboodle;
  * Added flip screen and cocktail support;
  * Merged memory maps in hyprduel.c.
- CPU cores are now enabled on a per cpu core family basis instead of per cpu core variant. As a result CPUDEFS is no longer needed in the makefile [Wilbert Pol].
- TMS320C25 fixes and enhancements: [Olivier Galibert]:
  * Accept IRQs on IDLE;
  * Actually count irq processing and instruction fetching cycles;
  * Add support for external serial frame sync with internal triggering (aka TXM=1 and FSM=1).
- Updated G-Net CHDs (reset to factory default settings and clear high-score table) [Guru].
- Added description of G-Net card/PCB [Guru].
- Fixed crash due to recent cheat engine changes [Pugsy].
- Fixed the sprite collision code of the mcu simulation in 'machine\mexico86.c' [Aladar].
- Improved sound banking in galpani2 driver [Luis Faria].
- Gameplan improvements [Tafoid]:
  * Verified and simplified the DIPs, adding locations.
  * Adjusted clocks in Leprechaun and Pirate Treasure based on info from the manual.
- Implemented model2 inputs through direct AM_READ_PORT access rather than using read handlers. The patch also fixes daytona brakes (which were previously labeled with the wrong tag) [Fabio Priuli].
- Simplified input handling in Taito F3 games [Fabio Priuli].
- Various PGM fixes and improvements [XingXing].
- Fixed rdft2j2 set, it was using rdft roms instead of the rdft2 ones [David Haywood].
- Additional PGM improvements [David Haywood]:
  * Added emulation of the earlier type of ARM (ASIC27A, 5585E type). Used this for protection emulation on 'Photo Y2k', 'Knights of Valour Superheroes instead of old simulation code;
  * Disabled protection simulation for several sets. This demotes 'Knights of Valour' and 'Knights of Valour Plus' to NOT working as there is no dump of the internal ROM;
  * Photo Y2k still works because it's using the emulation added above, but You can no longer change region as this is supplied by the ASIC27A device which is now emulated. This is correct;
  * Added several new sets, several of which are re-releases of the games using the ASIC 27A instead of the previous protection devices (oldss, killbldp);
  * Removed per-game speedup hacks, as they're no longer needed for the ARM based games to boot correctly.
- Fixed core_strwildcmp by increasing the limit from 8 to 16 characters [smf].
- Verified and simplified munchmo DIPs, and added locations. Also fixed clock speeds and AY-8910 clock to match recordings [Tafoid].
- Verified DIPs and added locations for Road Fighter. Adjusted defaults to match the manual [Tafoid].
- In bublbobl, emulated CPU1 (slave) <-> AUDIOCPU communications and AUDIOCPU reset at startup, previously this was disabled. [Mamesick].
- Added samples emulation to Rough Ranger (V2.0), write ports A & B of YM2203 are used [Mamesick].
- Added game-specific kludge to get music in SD Gundam Psycho Salamander [Mamesick].
- Fixed G-NET on big-endian hosts [R. Belmont].
