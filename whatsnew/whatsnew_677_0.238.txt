F387X PEP System [Bitsavers]

-f8: Add callback for overriding the normal reset address [AJR]

-frontend: Refactored menu event handling and fixed a number of issues (#8777) [Vas Crabb]
 * Moved common code for drawing about box, info viewer, and other text box menus to a base class; removed the last of the info
    viewer logic and the multi-line item hack from the base menu class.
 * Added previous/next group navigation for general inputs and plugin input selection menus.
 * Moved message catalog logic to lib/util, allowing osd and emu to use localised messages.
 * Made the base menu class use the UI manager’s feature for holding session state rather than a static map and mutex.
 * Improved menu event handling model, and fixed many issues, particularly with menus behaving badly when hidden/shown.
 * Added better support for menus that don’t participate in the usual menu stack, like the menuless sliders and the save/load state
    menus.
 * Made a number of menus refresh state when being shown after being hidden (fixes MT08121 among other issues).
 * Fixed indication of mounted slot option in the slot option details menu.
 * Improved appearance of background menus when emulation isn't running - draw all menus in the stack, and darken the background
    menus to make the edges of the active menu clearer.
 * Fixed locale issues in -listxml.

-debugger: Made GUI debuggers more uniform [Vas Crabb].
 * Added new memory view features to Win32 debugger.
 * Fixed spelling of hexadecimal in Cocoa debugger and added decimal address option.
 * Fixed duplicate keyboard shortcut in Cocoa debugger (Shift-Cmd-D was both new device window and 64-bit float format).
 * Made keyboard shortcuts slightly more consistent across debuggers.

-plugins: Moved input selection menu and sequence polling code to a common library.  Fixed the issue that prevented keyboard inputs
 being mapped with -steadykey on [Vas Crabb].

-docs: Started adding some documentation for MAME's internal UI, and updated the list of example front-ends [Vas Crabb].

-Regenerated message catalog sources.  For translators, the new strings are mostly [Vas Crabb]:
 * The names of the inputs provided by the OS-dependent layer for things like fullscreen and video features. These show up in the
    user interface inputs menu.
 * The names for automatically generated views. These show up in the video options menu - test with a system with a lot of screens
    to see more variants.
 * The input macro plugin UI.
 * A few format strings for analog input assignments.
 * A few strings for the about box header.

-frontend: Make all the textbox menus use the custom navigation flag, on the off chance they become scrollable somehow [Vas Crabb].

-ctk2100: added to mame.lst [Robbbert]

-bus/nes_ctrl: Fixed Family Trainer button reads (#8773) [kmg]
 * Column input reads now are now shifted to correct bit, fixing reads for top two rows.
 * Button presses are correctly 0 bits.
 * Multiple rows can be scanned per read.
 * Flipped key bindings on mat side A - now left/right correspond to left/right on mat.

-gt913: log two more unknown sound commands (#8779) [Devin Acker]

-gts3, gts3a: WIP [Robbbert]

-Fix various usability issues [Vas Crabb]:
 * frontend: Made it so you can press UI On Screen Display to hide the Analog Controls menu and see the response to your inputs
    without the risk of changing settings, and see more axes at once and scroll them for systems with very large number of axes.
    Also ensure the axis being configured is visible when the menu is visible, and made the menu behave a bit more like the system
    input assignments menu (including previous/next group navigation).
 * frontend: Allow Lua to draw to the UI container - this addresses the main complaint in #7475.  Note that drawing to the UI
    container will draw over any UI elements, including menus.  Plugins can check menu_active to avoid drawing over menus.  Also
    removed some unnecessary use of sol::overload.
 * frontend: Improved info/image box navigation on the system/softwre selection menus, and cleaned up some leftover code that came
    from the copy/pasted event handling functions.
 * frontend: Fixed sliders menu not handling Alt+Shift as intended (thanks Coverity).  Fixed a couple of harmless Coverity errors,
    too.
 * emu/inpttype.ipp: Made the default assignment for Save State recognise right shift.
 * plugins: Added next/previous group navigation to input macro edit menu.
 * docs: Added basic description of the system and software selection menus, and corrected a couple of errors in the Lua reference.

-docs: Fix an error in the Lua reference that I copy/pasted without noticing [Vas Crabb].

Software list items promoted to working (nes.xml)
-------------------------------------------------
Super Mogura Tataki!! Pokkun Moguraa (Japan) [kmg]

-emu/ioport.cpp: Made default behaviour better [Vas Crabb].
 * If an input is configured to some combination of controls that are not present at all, ignore the setting altogether for the
    session.
 * Fixed relative axes with PORT_RESET not responding to absolute controls (MT07685).
 * Fixed relative axes not responding to an absolute control if the value doesn’t change every frame (eg. holding a stick against
    the stop).
 * Changed the scaling for absolute controls assigned to relative axes to make defaults more sane (e.g. arkanoid or spdheat with a
    joystick).

-frontend: Fixed some localisation issues in Analog Controls menu [Vas Crabb].

-docs: Added documentation on assigning inputs [Vas Crabb].

-emu/ioport.cpp: Fixed some default setting handling issues [Vas Crabb].
 * Issues were unlikely to actually manifest unless you use controller configuration files to change specific system input defaults.

-src/emu/output.h: Added size accessor to multi-element output finder [Vas Crabb].
 * std::size will work on the top rank of an outut finder now.  Sorry for hitting emu.h again so soon.

-lua: Exposed a couple more input related things [Vas Crabb].
 * Exposed constructor and a few methods on input_seq required for scripts to properly clear assignments or restore default
    settings.
 * Exposed ioport_manager::set_type_seq which is required to configure general input assignments properly.
 * Removed unnecessary use of sol::overload in favour of optional parameters.
 * Updated documentation and also fixed a few errors.

-docs: Added description for axis setting assignments [Vas Crabb].

New machines marked as NOT_WORKING
----------------------------------
Space Poker  [Robbbert]

-plugins: Rewrote timer plugin fixing multiple issues [Vas Crabb].
 * Added emulated time recording as well as wall clock time.
 * Fixed recording time for multiple software items per system.  An incorrect constraint on the database table meant that time was
    only being recorded for a single software item per system.
 * Detect the "empty" driver so the time spent at the selection menu isn't recorded (you'd get multiple entries for this due to the
    way options leak when returning to the system selection menu).
 * Included schema migration code to update existing timer plugin databases.  Also replaced some unnecessary floating point code
    with integer maths, added log messages, and made the plugin unload unload its database access code during emulation.
 * Changed other plugins' use of paths with trailing slashes as this causes stat to fail on Windows.

-Enabled complex combinations for analog axes [Vas Crabb]:
 * Made it possible to add digital controls to axis settings as enables.
 * Mix multiple analog controls assigned to an axis setting.
 * Added a "reverse" modifier for analog controls (useful with mixing).
 * Fixed an issue assigning mouse axes using multiple mouse-like devices with -nomultimouse.

-frontend: More cleanup [Vas Crabb]:
 * Got rid of some abuse of "special main menus".
 * Added a helper class for auto-pause menus that don't spawn submenus.
 * Got rid of the fake menu that schedules an exit on the first frame.
 * Turned the confirm quit prompt into a menu, eliminated one more special-cased event loop.
 * Fixed the confirm quit prompt resuming if you return to emulation if you weren't paused to begin with.

-bus/centronics: Fixed conflicting DIP locations, reversed order and inverted polarity for Epson printers [Vas Crabb].
 * Also added the LX-810 (without L suffix) DIP switches for reference - we don't have a device for this printer yet.

-input: Clarify docuemntation and a comment [Vas Crabb].

 * Increased sensitivity for patocar trackball – it seemed too slow with mouse or analog stick.

-frontend: Handle analog controls with high sensitivity numbers better [Vas Crabb].

-arcadia.cpp: Removed commented PORT_RESET - it makes no sense for joysticks anyway [Vas Crabb].

-cps1.cpp: Fixed 2 players mode DIP switch for sf2cejx and sf2hfj.  (#8797) [Sergio G]
 * Looks like Capcom inverted the default configuration (OFF) to set "2 Credits/Continue" option by default in "sf2cejx" and
    "sf2hfj", instead "1 Credit/No Continue" present in "sf2jx".

-a1supply.cpp: corrected clock [Ivan Vangelista]

-micropin.cpp: pentacup working, and WIP for pentacup2. Split into derived classes [Robbbert].

-frontend: Various minor improvements [Vas Crabb].
 * Made a few more menus reset values to the default in response to the UI clear input.
 * Made the minimum info text size less unreasonable, and fixed a locale issue in the font/size selection menu when parsing option
    strings.
 * Made the keyboard mode menu toggle items on double click or UI select.
 * Made the menuless sliders menu remember the last slider shown (this probably broke when sliders were moved out of the UI manager
    itself).
 * Made a few menus just update the highlighted options when it's adjusted rather than unnecessarily rebuilding the menu.
 * Made a few more menus reset on being reactivated to cope with scripts or other things changing stuff out from under them.

-nes.xml: Updated the rest of the Family Trainer games to fully working (#8826) [kmg]

-3rdparty: Updated ASIO to version 1.20.0 [Vas Crabb].
 * The doc folder isn't included as it's pretty big.
 * This required include/asio/detail/win_iocp_socket_accept_op.hpp due to mismatched order in the member declarations and
    initialiser list for the win_iocp_socket_accept_op class.  I reversed the declaration order so it matches
    win_iocp_socket_move_accept_op.

-Actually commit the source changes for ASIO 1.20.0 update [Vas Crabb].
 * Also changed the fix to ASIO itself to match the upstream change in commit cd68912b7eb07f24e501e8cbff832b61ec292eea.
