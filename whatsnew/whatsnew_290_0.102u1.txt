Source changes:
---------------
- Added new inline math functions to mamecore.h, along with mechanisms for the OSD layer to override them with platform-specific variants: count_leading_zeros, count_leading_ones, and fixed_mul_shift. Updated the TMS32031 core to make use of the first two [Aaron Giles].
- Added redump of bad ROMs for "Cruis'n World' (rev L1.3) [Guru].
- Added very, very preliminary emulation of the Ricoh RF5C400 [Ville Linde].
- Changed some i386 disassembly parameters to be unsigned [Nathan Woods].
- Changed the Windows blitters to use an array allocated by osd_alloc_executable() to prevent potential access violations on systems with no-execute support [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed compilation issue for MSVC when using the winalloc code [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed output of mame.ini options that have spaces in them [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed some minor problems with the LOD calculations in the Voodoo driver [Aaron Giles].
- Improvements to 'Wheels and Fire', partial understanding of the blitter [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina].
- Replaced the 68705 MCU from the bootleg Knight Boy with simulation. Added 'Knight Boy' to keep using the MCU code [Nicola Salmoria].
- Several fixes for the kaneko16 drivers [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]:
  * Fixed tilemap priorities.
  * Fixed some sprites priorities.
  * Added some missing coin counters.
  * Added right palette filling for games using sprite type 1.
  * Swapped berlwall and berlwalt sets as per SebV notes in the source code.
