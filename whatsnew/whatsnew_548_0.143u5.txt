Source changes:
---------------
- Implemented double buffering and improved colors for 3d in Top Landing [Angelo Salese].
- naomi.c: Added rev "A" Japan BIOS, original Korean BIOS as well as rev "D" Korea [gamerfan, Smitdogg, BrianT, The Dumping Union].
- armedf.c: Verified correct sprite roms for Terra Force (Japan) [ShouTime].
- dday.c: Added DIP switch locations to the D-Day sets [Corrado Tomaselli, Brian Troha].
- m68k: Preliminary support for MC68340 (CPU32).  Reorganized to facilitate C++ conversion [David Haywood].
- m68k: use 68340 instruction table for 68340, cpXXX instructions are 020/030 only, add CINV, CPUSH stubs for 040 [R. Belmont].
- Add comment about new raiden2 ROM combination, add missing pals as undumped, fix IC locations on several sets [Lord Nightmare, Hammad, EdCosta].
- Various HLSL fixes: [Ryan Holtz, Bat Country Entertainment]:
  * Created two flags, -hlsl_ini_write and -hlsl_ini_read. The former enables custom HLSL INI writing explicitly, the other enables loading of the same;
  * Fixed disappearing aperture effect when using custom INI files;
  * Fixed diagonal seam on some games, for serious real this time;
  * Fixed phosphor simulation, now works as expected.
- model3.c: Redumped Spikeout FE. Special thanks to Phil Bennett & Bart. Trzynadlowski for verifying and testing the redumped ROMd [Dr.Spankenstein, wild eyed, Paratech, Layne, Lord Flux, atchoo, cbt, gatt9, tormod, BrianT, The Dumping Union].
- Only report samples audit result for sets with required samples [Fabio Priuli].
- Fixed segfault when using -verifysamples [Fabio Priuli].
- floppy: Refactor slightly.  Name, descrition, etc are now an intrinsic property of converters [Olivier Galibert].
- Added some Stern Whitestar older revisions [Miodrag Milanovic].
- Preliminary work at the projection calculation for 3d eye-space points in Air Inferno [Angelo Salese, Andrew Gardner].
- es5503: Converted to modern device, improved IRQ timing [R. Belmont].
- C352: Don't try to play zero-length samples [Phil Bennett].
- M377xx improvements:
  * Respect the restored mode bits for PUL [hap, R. Belmont].
  * Proper cycle counts for PSH/PUL [R. Belmont].
  * Fixed flags for multiply/division and divide by 0 interrupt [hap].
  * Pass program bank to debugger hook so breakpoints work outside of bank 0 [R. Belmont].
  * Fixed interrupt flags for internal peripherals, corrected BBC/BBS when running outside of bank 0 [R. Belmont].
  * Several other interrupt timing and priority fixes [hap].
- whitestar: Make modern, add sound system. No work on main CPU part yet [R. Belmont].

- mfi: Fix the format thanks to smf's help [Olivier Galibert].
- amigafdc: Modernize, but don't change a thing (yet) [Olivier Galibert].
- floppy: Change the internal format to use magnetic cells. Temporarily move the full-track pll bit extraction in the amiga fdc [Olivier Galibert].
- st_dsk: Add the easy ST formats [Olivier Galibert].
- tempest.c: Corrected the ROM labels, description and documentation for the revised hardware rev 3 of Tempest. Added DIP switch locations for the Tempest sets [Brian Troha].
- globalfr: Filled in a little more of the memory map [R. Belmont].

  * Added correct v1 to pulstar;
  * Corrected layout of pgoal according to original cart.
- Added redumped c1/c2 and v1 to quizdaisk [DsNo].
- Various changes and improvements to the Chihiro emulation [Samuele Zannoli]:

  * Adds "chihiro" command with subcommands "jamdis", "dump_string", "dump_process", "dump_list", "help";
  * Updates the smbus controller and adds stubs for the pic16lc, cx25871, eeprom smbus devices;
  * Updates the memory map for the newly added devices;
  * Fixes the size of the "others" region;
  * Adds hack for the missing dump of the smbus eeprom.
