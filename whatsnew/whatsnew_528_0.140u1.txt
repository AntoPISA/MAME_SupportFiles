MAME Testers Bugs Fixed (2):
----------------------------
- 04096: [DIP/Input] sjryuko: Most inputs do not work (Angelo Salese)
- 02561: [Interface] Ability to choose a different name for the UI font (Aaron Giles)


Source changes:
---------------
- Create new class osd_interface to house OSD callbacks. Added new module osdepend.c with default empty implementations. Changed mame_execute() and cli_execute() to accept a reference to an osd_interface which is provided by the caller [Aaron Giles].
- Updated SDL and Windows OSD to create an osd_interface-derived class and moved their OSD callbacks to be members [Aaron Giles].
- Make osdmini build again. [Aaron Giles]
- Discrete Sound: Added DISCRETE_XTIME_xxx logic modules. These allow you to do logic operations on nodes that use x_time anti-alias info. Added the ability to decode x_time to the DISCRETE_BIT_DECODE module. This means you can have an oscillator pass x_time onto a counter, get the counter bits decoded, pass that through the new logic modules and also have them convert the x_time to energy/anti-alaised voltage. Updated Donkey Kong Jr. to use these new modules [Derrick Renaud].
- Convert rendfont to C++ [Aaron Giles].
- [SDL Debugger] Removed an unnecessary assert and brought focus back to the main debugger window on startup [Andrew Gardner].
- Added support for OSD-generated fonts. The OSD is queried first to see if it owns a given font (based on the name), and if it does, it is responsible for generating bitmaps on the fly as characters are requested [Aaron Giles].
- Added new option -uifont to specify the UI font. It can be set to a filename, in which case a BDF font will be loaded. It can also be set to a font name (assuming the OSD support is present), in which case the OSD font by that name is used. The default value is 'default' which can be used by the OSD to substitute a default font or by the OSD, which will default to ui.bdf as before. In all cases, it falls back to the built-in font by default if none of the previous options works [Aaron Giles].

  NOTE: On Windows, the OSD will default to Tahoma as the font name. 
  Also on Windows, font names can be specified with [b] to indicate 
  bold or [i] to indicate italic.

- Use "default" font for artwork elements as well. Make UI backgrounds a bit more opaque. Fix crash when passing NULL filename to OSD code [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed and verified with Test Mode the few System 18 bootlegs located in the system16.c driver for Inputs and Dip Switches [Tafoid].
- Discrete Updates: Removed old DISCRETE_74LS624 code and replaced it with new 74LS629 based code. Updated Mario to use new DISCRETE_74LS624 and DISCRETE_XTIME_logic modules [Derrick Renaud].
- C++-ified the cheat engine [Aaron Giles].
- Naomi updates:
  * Redumped Kick 4 Cash to fix bad dumps [f205v] .
  * Completed dump of Neo Geo Battle Coliseum [Guru].
- i286.c: Moved call of i80286_urinit to CPU_INIT. Fixed display of PC in the debugger [Wilbert Pol].
- M6805: Add extremely preliminary 68HC05EG support [R. Belmont].
- i80186/i80286: Fixed bound instruction restart when prefixed with a segment [Wilbert Pol].
- i286.c: Partially implemented protected mode. Fixed verw, verr, lar, lsl, and arpl instructions [Wilbert Pol].
- Atari Cops'n Robbers updates [Derrick Renaud]:
  * Converted controls to Positional type;
  * Started Discrete sounds (Motor 2 & 3, Crash sounds implemented);
  * Added Motor 0 & 1, and Zings sounds. Zings sound not hooked up until address for Fires & Zings is found;
- Optimized speed of DISCRETE_DAC_R1 [Derrick Renaud]
- Converted the expression engine to C++, did the usual cleanup [Aaron Giles].
- Neo Geo changes [Johnboy]:
  * maglord/maglordh: Mixed up crc's, fixed;
  * flipshot: Added correct p1;
  * kotm2: Tagged MVS AND AES VERSION;
  * miexchng: Added correct c3/c4;
  * Updated game PCB info;
  * Continued to document mask ROM types.
- Fixed crash in cubocd32/akiko [Mariusz Wojcieszek].
- Atari Cops'n Robbers Updates [Derrick Renaud].
- Fixed operation of DISCRETE_COUNTER_7492 [Derrick Renaud].
- kofxi: Redumped mask ROMs due to error in TSOP70 adaptor [Cah4e3].
- Added UTF-8 constants for cursor key arrows, and accented characters on the Swedish/Finnish keyboard layout [Curt Coder].
- Removed deprecat.h usage and rewritten IRQ routines in DJ Boy [Angelo Salese].
