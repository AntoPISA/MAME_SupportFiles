- debug: Fix a string overflow in comments [Fabrice Bellet].

- New functions added:
  MCFG_STEPPER_ADD(tag) - add a stepper device.
  MCFG_STEPPER_REEL_TYPE(type) - the equivalent of the first line in the old interface, now also takes NOT_A_REEL for printer and similar applications.      
  MCFG_STEPPER_START_INDEX(int index) - the old second line of the interface, the position (in half steps) where the optic tab first triggers.           
  MCFG_STEPPER_END_INDEX(int index)  - the old third line of the interface, the last position (in half steps) where the optic tab triggers. 
  MCFG_STEPPER_INDEX_PATTERN(int pattern) - a coil pattern in hexadecimal that has to be on the motor for the index to trigger (0 if no specific pattern is needed) 
  MCFG_STEPPER_INIT_PHASE(int phase) - starting phase of the motor. All drivers have been updated, testing done to all specific drivers - 'Scorpion 4' was particularly complex [James Wallace].
- qt/debug: Device tree view. Looks cool with mu100 or lindbios [Olivier Galibert].

- chihiro: added support for zbuffer and stencil plus render target methods [Samuele Zannoli].
- Fix "-mt" for SDLMAME windows build [Calamity, Couriersud].
- Changed sdl_window_info to be closer to C++ [Couriersud]:
  * Made some members private;
  * Moved static functions into sdl_window_info;
  * Extended work_param struct with constructors for better readability.
- Fixed save state regressions in the following drivers: arcadecl.c, batman.c, eprom.c, foodf.c, liberatr.c, atarisys2.c, gstream.c, pasha2.c, f-32.c, lastfght.c, bfm_sc1.c, bmcpokr.c, centiped.c, jangou.c, merit.c, segas16a.c, asteroid.c, seibuspi.c [Osso].
- Started developing a CPU core for the series of processors based on the ARCompact instruction set, namely the ARCtangent A-5. This is still preliminary, the disassembly is mostly complete but the output could still be tidied, and many instructions are not yet implemented and based on code execution some of the ones that are could be incorrect. This is currently used by the 'leapster' driver [David Haywood].
- m68k: Generate the correct kind of stack frame for 68010 bus errors [R. Belmont].
