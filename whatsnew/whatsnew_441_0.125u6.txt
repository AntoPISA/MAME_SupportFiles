- 01888: [DIP/Input] raidena, raidenk, raident: Flip screen DIP switch doesn't work (Couriersud).


Source changes:
---------------
- MIPS3 recompiler [Aaron Giles]:
  * Added UML comments for common state variables;
  * Removed some unused fields;
  * Implemented LL/LLD/SC/SCD (only works single-processor for now).
- Added sound emulation to "Wily Tower", "Atomic Boy" and "Fighting Basketball" [Tomasz Slanina].
- Improvements to (squahitsa) [David Haywood].
- Progress on protection simulation for 2 Crystal System titles. Still not working [ElSemi].
- Some progress on (tankfrc4) inputs [David Haywood].
- Created common virtual TLB managment module. Updated MIPS and PowerPC code to make use of it [Aaron Giles].
- Added a validity check against reading input ports at init time [Curt Coder].
- Cleaned up software bilinear filtering code. Added bounds checking. Enabled by default for snapshots and movie rendering [Aaron Giles].
- Added new option: -snapsize, which lets you specify the target resolution for snapshots and movies. The existing behavior is still the default: create snapshots and movies at native pixel resolutions [Aaron Giles].
- Added new option: -snapview, which lets you specify a particular view to use for rendering snapshots and movies. The existing behavior is still the default: use a special internal view and render each screen to its own snapshot in its own file. When using this option to specify a view other than 'internal', only a single snapshot file will be produced regardless of how many screens the game has [Aaron Giles].
- Improved AVI and MNG recording to properly duplicate/skip frames as appropriate to keep the correct framerate [Aaron Giles].
- Added new function video_get_view_for_target() which selects a view based on a command-line parameter and the configuration. Changed Windows OSD code to use this instead of its own logic. Changed -snapview to share the logic as well, enabling 'auto' as a -snapview option [Aaron Giles].
- Renamed "Nintendo z80gb" CPU core to "Sharp LR35902" [Wilbert Pol].
- UML [Aaron Giles]:
  * Reactivated back-end validation mechanism;
  * Added back-end validation for ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV/CMP forms;
  * Fixed several errors in dealing with more obscure flag combinations.
- konamigx frequency tweaks [Yasuhiro Ogawa]:
  * Set screen refresh rate to 58Hz (parameters from  developer manual are not 100% correct);
  * Removed sound CPU clock hack.
- Set tecmosys screen refresh rate to measured 57.4458Hz [Guru].
- Added missing machine parameters and removed deprecat.h usage in a number of drivers/ and machine/ files [Oliver Stoenberg].
- Changed all games after 'Street Fighter 2 CE' to have a 12mhz clock. Verified on Megaman and Quiz and dragons (original kits with plastic case). I am resonably sure all the other games after ST2CE have the DASH cps1 board with 12mhz clock [Corrado Tomaselli].
- Converted many drivers in the d-j alphabetical range to use input_port_read() instead of input_port_read_indexed() [Fabio Puiuli].
- ddragon3 driver cleanups/fixes [sonikos]:
  * Fixed the mess dips location in (ctribe);
  * Added dips location in all sets of (ddragon3);
  * Added the missing DIPs (now are 8x2) on (ctribe), (ctribe1), (ctribeb), (ctribb2) and (ddrago3b);
  * Fixed the "Stage Clear Energy" DIPs in (ctribe);
  * Adjusted the frame rate from 60hz to around 57 as reported on mametester ID 00417;
  * Adjusted OKI frequency to 1.000mhz (according to recording on mametester ID 00181);
  * Adjusted the (ddragon3) and (ctribe) volume (according to recording on mametester ID 00181 and 01441).
- Some protection improvements for vgoalsoc / tecmo world cup 98 [nuapete].
