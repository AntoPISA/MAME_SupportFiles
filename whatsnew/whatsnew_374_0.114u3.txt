Source changes:
---------------
- Additional CDP1802 updates, taken from MESS [Curt Coder].
- Fixed colors in One + Two [Tomasz Slanina].
- Made the PowerPC dynarec options runtime configurable [Ville Linde].
- Added save state support to the hatris/pipedrm driver [Couriersud].
- Corrected Moustache Boy main cpu interrupt rate, main cpu clock freq, and screen refresh rate according to measurements on a real PCB [Tormod Tjaberg].
- Separated the DECO and Mitchell games in the simpl156 driver and added more extensive documentation [Brian Troha].
- Fixed analog controls in Solar Assault [Ville Linde].
- Changed the options code so that ranges are specified on the option_entry structure, and enforced when option values are changed [Nathan Woods].
- Further improved the ROZ layer emulation in the K001604 [Ville Linde].
- Konami ZR107 update [Ville Linde]:
  * Fixed sound hardware check in Winding Heat;
  * Changed to use the correct tilemap chip type;
  * Hooked up analog controls;
  * Fixed texture ROM loading and texture decoding;
  * Improved the 2D tilemaps.
- Introduced a mame_options_exit() call to complement mame_options_init() [Nathan Woods].
- Added a mame_fopen_options() call, similar to mame_fopen() but with the ability to specify a core_options object to use [Nathan Woods].
- Improved noise emulation in the SN76496 emulator. Added several variants which differ based on the noise generator and other parameters [Lord Nightmare].
- Changed all plot_pixel and read_pixel calls to BITMAP_ADDRXX macros. Removed the now-obsolete functions [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Added support for aliasing sound types. This allows minor variants in sound cores to share the same fundamental "type" so that the same sndti_* functions can be used regardless of the subtype [Aaron Giles].
- Changed location of save state files. Now they are placed in the <savestate>/<gamename> directory. Auto-generated save state files have the name "auto.sta". All other save state files are named <slot>.sta [Aaron Giles].
