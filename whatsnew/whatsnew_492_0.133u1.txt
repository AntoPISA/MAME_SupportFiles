- Made IRQs more accurate in City Connection [Angelo Salese].
- Hooked up Cobra Command sound ROM [Jim Hernandez, Aaron Giles].

- Calc 3 update [David Haywood]:
  * Shuffled a few things around based on new findings.
  * Added an extra decryption table used for the Brap Boys startup code (still doesn't do anything interesting).
  * Noted that one of the unknown parameters for the MCU Init command is where it reads / writes eeprom data from.
  * Noted that an additional parameter in the MCU commands may cause further displacement of the writeback address, as BRap Boys seems to rely on this (needs further testing) - added a hack for now so that BRap Boys places the writeback address of the initial table somewhere that causes it to get executed.
- Marked graphics ROMs on Led Storm Rally 2011 (US) as bad, as they cannot possibly be the right ones for this set [David Haywood].
- Properly added support for namcos2 multiple posirq anyway. Fixes the following issues [hap]:
  * starblad polys.
  * fourtrax track and mirror.
  * dirtfoxj game start spotlight effect, game still locks up tho.

  * Updated all of the TRON sets with location of the roms and the board they belong to.
  * Updated the name of the PROM on the Super Sound I/O board.
  * Added notes about PALs that need to be dumped (The same PAL part numbers are also  used on Xenophobe and probably other MCR II & III games).
- Fixed chdman -update to leave the write protect state alone when updating uncompressed CHDs [Michael Zapf].
- Changed default key for Mahjong P1 Bet to '3', because '2' was conflicting with P2 Start in 2 players Mahjong games [Fabio Priuli].
