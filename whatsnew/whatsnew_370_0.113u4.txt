Source changes:
---------------
- Improved the K001604 ROZ layer emulation [Ville Linde].
- Added the timing parameters for the Exidy 6502 driver from the schematics, and updated a number of other drivers to use the newer timing routines [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Exidy 440 driver update [Zsolt Vasvari]:
  * Added video timing from schematics.
  * Added the 9 timing PROMs to the ROMsets.
  * All the games appear to use the same timing PROMs with the exception of Top Secret, which sets the VBLANK 4 pixels earlier. This fixes the game graphics, but cuts of the very bottom row of  the year display on the title screen. It's most likely a real issue in the game, as tweaking the behavior adds garbage pixels to all the other games.
- Updated the itech32 driver to configure video timing dynamically according to how the chip is programmed [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Hooked up the new TGP core to the Model 2 driver, mapped the TGP data ROMs properly, and updated the TGP core to the latest information [Ville Linde, Ernesto Corvi, ElSemi].
- Fixed irobot crash introduced in last timing update [Zsolt Vasvari].
- ES5503 updates [R. Belmont]:
  * Major fixes to IRQ semantics and end-of-sample handling.
  * Sample memory now configurable
  * Added state save support.
  * Calculates output rate properly based on the input clock.
  * Hooked up properly to mquake.
- Added analog controls for 'GTI Club' [Ville Linde].
- Fixed crashes in some games using the SCSP [R. Belmont].
- Now enabling all CPUs by default, which helps ensure that even unused CPUs get updated with core changes, etc [David Haywood].
- Optimized the options code and memory pool code to use hashes for faster searching [Nathan Woods].
- Cleaned up and more heavily documented the tumbleb driver [Brian Troha].
- G65816/M37710 CPU core updates [R. Belmont]:
  * Fixed a race condition in the WAI instruction where the CPU could  get stuck. (MESS bug #661, may have caused intermittent issues with Namco games in MAME too).
  * Fixed block transfer instructions when the accumulator is in short mode. (Fixes some SNES games not booting, notably 'Final Fantasy Mystic Quest').
- Corrected dip and added dip locations to 'Pettan Pyuu', 'Banbam', the markham driver, and 'Calorie Kun vs Moguranian' [Brian Troha].
- Updated the Leland driver to the new video timing routines, as well as the remaining drivers. Removed now-obsolete old timing routines from cpuexec [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Added more recently discovered opcodes to the MB86233 core and disassembler [Ernesto Corvi, ElSemi]
- Created WINOPTIONS_* constants for Windows OSD options [Nathan Woods].
- Updated the World Cup 90 DIP switches corrected from manual. Also added diplocations [Roberto Fresca].
- Changed CDP1869 to use proper write handlers for MESS [Curt Coder].
- Added v60_stall mechanism to allow for synchronization between the V60 core and an external CPU [Ernesto Corvi].
- Changed behavior of extra one-pixel border on Direct3D textures so that the edge pixel is smeared into the border rather than leaving the border black. This should eliminate a few oddities at the edges of texture rendering [Aaron Giles].
- Updated video code to double buffer texture objects to reduce contention of render primitive lists. Also changed rendering code to explicitly alternate between primitive lists to prevent throwing away old lists prematurely [Aaron Giles].
