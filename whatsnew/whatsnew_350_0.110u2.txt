Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed flags access in the i286 core [Barry Rodewald].
- Updated MC146818 module to use new core date/time routines [Nathan Woods].
- Cleaned up disassemblers to remove stubs and ensure the disassemblers are not referenced except in debug builds [Nathan Woods].
- Added support for using CHDs to decrypt CPS2 games. This code is disabled for the moment, but will be enabled in the future. Only a handful of games have complete tables so far. These tables are huge (~4GB) and uncompressable until the encryption algorithm is understood [David Haywood].
- Fixed bug in the debugger that caused watchpoints to not be active until the next context switch [smf].
- Cleaned up the input definitions for n-way joysticks so they are more explicit. Added concept of a "16-way" joystick, which is a joystick that doesn't prevent simultaneous opposing directions from bring reported [smf].
- Major System 573 update [smf]:
  * Fixed PSX SIO control register behavior.
  * Implemented several SCSI CD commands: START/STOP UNIT, PAUSE/RESUME, READ SUB-CHANNEL, READ TOC.
  * Added uPD4701 emulation.
  * Fixed ATAPI reset, PIO, and command IDENTIFY PACKET DEVICE.
  * Hooked up controls for fishing, DRR, and Guitar Freaks games.
  * Hooked up CDDA audio.
  * Removed some unused bytes from the Konami 80's security chips.
- Fixed upside down service mode in the commando.c driver [Canim].
- Added support for the Triple Hunt 8-track audio [Derrick Renaud].
- Galaxian/Scramble driver reorganization [Atari Ace]:
  * machine/scramble.c is broken up into two files, machine/galaxian.c and machine/scramble.c.
  * drivers/amidar.c, drivers/frogger.c, drivers/scobra.c get copies of some of the data structures they shared from other drivers.
  * galaxian_base is made static and uses outside of the main driver were rewritten.
  * cclimber_decode code from drivers/cclimber.c was separated into its own machine/cclimber.c file to allow mshuttle to share it without taking on other dependencies.
- Added missing x-flipping support in Major Havoc [Mathis Rosenhauer].
- Made some improvements to trivia madness driver. There still is something wrong in the question roms banking [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- More updates to the ST-V driver [Mariusz Wojcieszek]:
  * vdp1: added shading for sprites (used by znpwfv, cotton, others). Fixed sprite clipping (fixes incorrect sprites in znpwfv). Fixed transparency on colour lookup table sprites (fixes bad sprites in znpwfv).
  * vdp2: Fixed caching of RGB layer (fixes bad backgrounds on bosses in rsgun). Added additive blending for tilemaps and sprites (rsgun). Added vertical line scroll and linezoom (fixes diehard logo).
  * stv: Improved speedups for diehard. Fixed speedups for znpwfv. Added preliminary save state support.
- Significant cleanup of chd.c [Aaron Giles]:
  * Got rid of the horrible last_error concept; now all routines return an error directly.
  * Fixed several issues in managing metadata.
  * Changed compression and verification routines to be client-driven rather than monolithic.
  * Changed internal codec usage to be more flexible.
  * Altered chdman and MAME to use the new interfaces.
  * Added new -createraw command for creating raw data CHDs.
- Fixed crash bug in romcmp when comparing ZIP files [Aaron Giles].
