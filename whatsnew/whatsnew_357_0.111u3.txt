Source changes:
---------------
- Added save state support to the tubep driver [Svante Gerhard].
- Added save state support to the steppers module [James Wallace].
- Added the remaining input pins to the SN76477 Interface. If these pins are constant, they can now be defined in the structure as opposed to having to call functions in an init routine. Modified all the drivers that use a 76477 [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Removed file I/O functions from osd_tool.h in favor of the ones in osdepend.h. Updated tools accordingly. Added new flag OSD_FLAG_CREATE_PATHS to the open command [Nathan Woods].
- Moved OKIM6295 pin 7 state (internal divider) to internal structure. Updated all drivers to specify pin state when setting the interface. Added comments for all cases where the original frequency wasn't / 132 or /165 as the real pin state is unknown [David Haywood].
- Updated Toki driver to display visual DIPs for the game [Brian Oberholtzer].
- Added sprite X flip and removed unneeded hack in wheelfir driver [Tomasz Slanina].
- Fixed several issues with the new Unicode support [Nathan Woods].
- Changed uimenu.c to allow displaying DP switch banks which have gaps (unused switches) in them. These switches are now grayed out [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Another Amiga update [Ernesto Corvi]:
  * Fixed blitter in line mode.
  * Modified Copper to run on odd memory bus cycles.
  * Fixed screen delay offset when display data fetch is not word aligned.
- Fixed cheat searching [stephh].
- Replaced CPS2 CHDs with preliminary decryption function [Andreas Naive, Nicola Salmoria].
- Added code to validate that banks are only set to point to memory that has been allocated via auto_malloc(). Currently disabled pending further review [Nathan Woods].
- Updated input port tokenization for MESS. Added support in MAME for "configuration" switches which are separate from DIP switches. These can be used to configure aspects of the game that don't correspond to DIP switches. Modified pacman.c to use configurations to control the speedup options [Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles].
- Fixed invalid array access in the taito_l driver [Atari Ace].
- Made a fix minor compiler compatibility tweaks to the source [Atari Ace].
- Fixed several glitches and crashes related to the input port and unicode changes from u2 [Aaron Giles].
- Separated "core" OSD function definitions to osdcore.h. Added more extensive documentation [Aaron Giles].
- Created a new library called osdcore, which is now built and linked to each executable. Moved all definitions of expected components of osdcore into new header file osdcore.h, and added consistent documentation for them all. Removed osd_tool.c, and moved the necessary parts of its functionality into osdcore [Aaron Giles].
- Defined a new set of interfaces for osdcore which creates an abstract interface for queueing work items to be potentially executed on a secondary thread. Implemented the Windows versions of these routines, but have not done any testing yet [Aaron Giles].
- Separated Windows OSD core routines into individual files, as folows [Aaron Giles]:
  * windir.c: Directory-related core OSD functions.
  * winfile.c: File-related core OSD functions.
  * winmisc.c: Miscellaneous core OSD functions winsync.c - synchronization-related core OSD functions.
  * wintime.c - timing-related core OSD functions.
  * winwork.c - threading-related core OSD functions.
- Created new osdmini directory with minimal implementations of all the OSD core routines. These can be used to stub in functionality or as a starting point for new ports [Aaron Giles].
- Cleaned up chdman, normalizing its behavior and improving error reporting [Aaron Giles].
- More updates to the laserdisc emulation, based on more complete understanding of how the discs are encoded and how they will eventually be stored [Aaron Giles].
