New clones added
----------------

The Simpsons (2 Players Asia) [Arzeno Fabrice]


Source changes:
---------------
- Fixes clocks for 'Orbs' [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina].
- Fixed various 64-bit GCC warnings [R. Belmont].
- Improves accuracy and documentation of NSS/SNES DSP-1 [Andreas Naive, R. Belmont].
- Added new file xtal.h, documenting all known arcade PCB clock cystals. Drivers should be updated to use these as a basis for their clocks, and the list should be augmented as additional crystals are found [Guru, Aaron Giles].
- suprloco improvements [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]:
  * Fixed IC.34 memory test.
  * Fixed 2nd player cocktail mode.
  * Changed coin3 to service1.
- Cleaned up inputs/DIP switches in cninja driver [Brian Troha].
- Rewrote mario.c [Couriersud]:
  * Rewrote driver, separate MACHINE_DRIVER(mario_audio).
  * Palette from schematics.
  * Video timing from schematics.
  * Driver configuration switch Nintendo/Std Monitor.
  * Got rid of COLORTABLE.
- Fixed typo for IO1 irq callback in hyperstone core [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
- Added memory_get_bank() function. Fixed logging in memory.c to to use %p for pointer values [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed save states in i8051 cpu core [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Implemented a few SysCtrl, Maple, and PVR/HOLLY bits for Naomi. The BIOS gets slightly further but is nowhere near starting up [R. Belmont].
- Zeus updates [Aaron Giles]:
  * Better documented various bit latches.
  * Hooked up crusnexo lamp board (added layout).
  * Fixed year in MK4 startup test.
- Fixed TMS5110 tables [Couriersud, Lord Nightmare].
- Removed ui_popup(). Drivers should always be using popmessage() instead (has been this way for a while). Augmented popmessage() so that you can pass NULL to immediately dismiss any messages [Aaron Giles, thanks to Oliver Stoneberg's suggestion].
- Added ATTR_PRINTF to a number of functions that have printf semantics [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Rewrote sbrkout driver based on schematics [Aaron Giles]:
  * XTAL-based timing.
  * Correct video timing.
  * Full memory map.
  * Correct memory usage ("zero page" RAM is shared with videoram).
  * Removed all input hacks.
  * Fixed interrupt generation.
  * Connected coin counters.
  * Added save state support.
- Fixed several UNICODE=1 issues in the debugger. Changed the Windows build process to always enable UNICODE=1 for 64-bit builds [Oliver Stoneberg, Aaron Giles].
- Added save state support to btoads [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed onna34ro mcu simulation properly [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
