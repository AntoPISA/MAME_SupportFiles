Source changes:
---------------
- Fixes clocks for Orbs [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina].
- Fixed various 64-bit GCC warnings [R. Belmont].
- Improves accuracy and documentation of NSS/SNES DSP-1 [Andreas Naive, R. Belmont].
- Added new file xtal.h, documenting all known arcade PCB clock cystals. Drivers should be updated to use these as a basis for their clocks, and the list should be augmented as additional crystals are found [Guru, Aaron Giles].
- suprloco improvements [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]:
  * Fixed IC.34 memory test;
  * Fixed 2nd player cocktail mode;
  * Changed coin3 to service1.
- Cleaned up inputs/DIP switches in cninja driver [Brian Troha].
- Rewrote mario.c [Couriersud]:
  * Rewrote driver, separate MACHINE_DRIVER(mario_audio);
  * Palette from schematics;
  * Video timing from schematics;
  * Driver configuration switch Nintendo/Std Monitor;
  * Got rid of COLORTABLE.
- Fixed typo for IO1 irq callback in hyperstone core [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
- Added memory_get_bank() function. Fixed logging in memory.c to to use %p for pointer values [Aaron Giles].

  * Better documented various bit latches;
  * Hooked up crusnexo lamp board (added layout);
  * Fixed year in MK4 startup test.
- Fixed TMS5110 tables [Couriersud, Lord Nightmare].
- Removed ui_popup(). Drivers should always be using popmessage() instead (has been this way for a while). Augmented popmessage() so that you can pass NULL to immediately dismiss any messages [Aaron Giles, thanks to Oliver Stoneberg's suggestion].
- Added ATTR_PRINTF to a number of functions that have printf semantics [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Rewrote sbrkout driver based on schematics [Aaron Giles]:
  * XTAL-based timing;
  * Correct video timing;
  * Full memory map;
  * Correct memory usage ("zero page" RAM is shared with videoram);
  * Removed all input hacks;
  * Fixed interrupt generation;
  * Connected coin counters;
  * Added save state support.
- Fixed several UNICODE=1 issues in the debugger. Changed the Windows build process to always enable UNICODE=1 for 64-bit builds [Oliver Stoneberg, Aaron Giles].
