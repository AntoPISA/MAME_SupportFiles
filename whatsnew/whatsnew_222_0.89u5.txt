Source changes:
---------------
- Adjusted NamcoS2 sound balance [David Haywood].
- Solar Warrior driver update: fixed NMI & FIRQ handling according to schematics. Fixed clock speeds. Implemented GFX priority register/priority PROM [Bryan McPhail].
- IremGA20 64-bit crash fix [Stephen Behling].
- Misc updates [Nathan Woods]:
  * Fixed disassembler calls, so that instructions are not falsely disassembled as 32-bit;
  * Implemented SMSW instruction;
  * Marked retf instruction as DASMFLAG_STEP_OUT;
  * Added macros for pushfd() and popfd().
- Added 'TRACEOVER' support to debugger (see help) [Nathan Woods].
- New Debugger Commands [Aaron Giles]:
  * snap [<filename>]: Takes a snapshot and saves it to the given <filename>; if <filename> is omitted, this is equivalent to hitting F12;
  * gi[int] [<irqline>]: Executes until the current CPU takes the interrupt line specified by <irqline>; if <irqline> is omitted, executes until any IRQ is taken on the current CPU. This has been mapped to F7 as well;
  * gv[blank]: Executes until the next VBLANK; this is useful for stepping frame-by-frame from within the debugger. This has been mapped to F8.
- Various Improvements [Sebastien Volpe]:
  - galpani3:
  * Palette, inputs, sound hooked up, backgounds 'decoded' (RLE).
  - jchan:
  * Slight cleanup, sound hooked up, tile area identified;
  * jchan2 now passes initial checks.
  - kaneko16 (bonkadv):
  * Priorities corrected according Luca's scheme & sound 'improvements' (both banking and ROM loading);
  * Game name updated;
  * Interrupts scheduling change (not correct, but somewhat improved, see comment) and as a consequence, fake region dsw is removed.
  - srmp6:
  * New driver, Seta System 12?
  * Many things todo, gfx decoding would be nice!
  toki:
  * Correct frequencies.
- Started minor cleanup of System 32 driver (some things are probably broken for now) [David Haywood].
- hypereac2 sound fix, sh2 bounds overflow fix, atarijsa memcpy fix [Mame32Plus].
- Improvements to Namco 54xx Noise Generator. Type A, and B emulated, type C algo still unknown [Jarek Burczynski].
- Minor Sega Update [Aaron Giles]:
  * Renamed (dbrkr) to (desertbr);
  * Cleaned up the math chip emulation, should be much closer now;
  * Fixed off-by-1 column scroll in wrestwra;
  * Fixed shadows in S18 so they don't affect any VDP-drawn pixels.
