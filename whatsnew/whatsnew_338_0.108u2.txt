Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed options_output_ini_file() and options_output_ini_mame_file() to properly handle string options containing spaces [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed incorrect DIP switches in Trivia (Version 1.03), Selection, and Poker games (getrivia.c [wolf676].
- Added PORT_DIPLOCATION macros to a number of drivers based on research [Roberto Fresca].
- Fixed several issues with pausing and the multithreading code [Nathan Woods].
- Cleaned up the vacfdisp module to display 14 and 16 segment displays. Added a separate character set for the OKI MSC1937. Changes Scorpion 2 to the new system. Tidied up the 6840 emulator a bit [El Condor].
- Attempted to fix the bad Space Odyssey ROM by using data from the previous dump. It is still marked BAD_DUMP (we would like to get an actual dump), but the new Space Odyssey is now playable [MASH].
- Removed recently-introduced case dependency in the ROM naming [Buddabing].
- Added new option -multithreading (-mt) which enables the previous multithreaded rendering code. This code has had problems on some systems, especially pre-XP systems, so consider it experimental. If you want to help debug issues, enable LOG_THREADS in windows/window.c and post them to MAMETesters.org with a description of your problem and your system. If you don't have hyperthreading, dual core, or a multi-CPU system, don't bother turning this flag on [Aaron Giles]
- Changed the behavior of the led7seg primitive. It now no longer takes a state value but accepts states from 0-255, allowing independent control over all 7 segments and the decimal. Ordered the segments according to standard order. Updated the Turbo driver to do its own BCD decoding via an LS48 decoder to control the segments directly. This will break existing layouts using the led7seg primitive [Aaron Giles].
- Further turbo driver cleanup. Still in WIP [Aaron Giles]:
  * Derived sprite scaling from PROMs and R/C values (still not 100%).
  * Rewrote most of the video/sprite handling.
  * Identified all PROMs and used them where appropriate.
  * Added a more complete 8279 implementation.
  * Converted 7-segment LEDs to the new behavior described above.
