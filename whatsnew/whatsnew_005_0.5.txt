Program changes:
----------------
- Fixed some problems in the "Wizard of Wor" driver, but it is still far from complete [Nicola Salmoria].
- Support for [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * Donkey Kong Jr. (wrong colors, no sound);
  * Galaxians and the plethora of clones (correct colors, limited sound);
  * Pisces (correct colors, limited sound);
  * "Japanese Irem game". I believe the colors are correct, but since I've never seen the original game I can't know for sure;
  * War of the Bugs (wrong colors, limited sound);
  * Moon Cresta (wrong colors, limited sound);
  * The End (wrong colors, no sound).
- By popular demand, reverted to the old AY-3-8910 emulation code.


Source changes:
---------------
- Changed readroms() to allow scatter loading of a single ROM. This was needed for Donkey Kong Jr. Now the end of the RomModule array is marked by a size==0, while name==0 means "continue loading the previous ROM at this address" [Nicola Salmoria].
- New function copybitmap() in common.c. Limited for now, will change in the future [Nicola Salmoria].
- Some bug fixes and changes to reduce porting problems [Nicola Salmoria, Brad Oliver].
