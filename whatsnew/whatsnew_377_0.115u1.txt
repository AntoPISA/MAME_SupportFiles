Source changes:
---------------
- Added support for playback of "extended" INP files that are commonly found on compete sites [David Haywood].
- Added lswx and stswx opcodes to the PowerPC core [Ville Linde].
- Changed DRIVER_INIT macro to prepend driver_init_* instead of simply init_* to be consistent with the other initialization functions [Atari Ace].
- Corrected the pulse shape of the timer output in the MPU4 driver, and also correctly identified the AY sound chip as an AY8913 [James Wallace].
- Merged leprechn driver into the gameplan driver and added correct video timings [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Cleaned up the dorachan driver. Replaced fake color map with actual color PROM decoding [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Cleaned up the supertnk driver [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Move Atari vector PROMs into separate regions [Mathis Rosenhauer].
- Added DIP switches for Excite League [Barry Harris, Yasuhiro Ogawa].
- Improved m92 sprite drawing [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Rewrote the magicfly driver [Roberto Fresca]:
  * Figured out how the protection works;
  * Removed the hacks/patchs that formerly allow boot the games;
  * Figured out how the buffered inputs works;
  * Demuxed all inputs for both games;
  * Unified the memory maps from both games;
  * Added NVRAM support to both games;
  * Mapped DIP switches;
  * Managed the planes to get the 3bpp GFX colors accurate;
  * Renamed the ROMs acording to pcb pictures and ROM contents;
  * Cleaned up and optimized the driver.
- Fixed throttle range in gforce2 [David Haywood].
- Moved Win32 UTF-8 wrappers into a new module (winutf8.c) and added some new wrappers that Oliver Stoeneberg created for MAME32 [Nathan Woods].
- Aleck64/N64 update [Ryan Holtz]:
  * RSP: some opcodes bugfixed plus should work on big-endian targets;
  * Real PIF ROM dump now used and required;
  * Various other fixes.
- Fixed EEPROM handling in surfplnt [Couriersud].
- Fixed carry flag calculation for SUB/SBC/CMP family instructions in the ARM core [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz].
- Improvements to the ARM7 core [R. Belmont, Ryan Holtz]:
  * Fixed 32-bit unaligned reads to "scramble" properly;
  * Fixed carry flag calc for SUB/SBC/CMP family instructions;
  * Fixed multiply-and-accumulate instructions;
  * Added more instructions to the disassembler;
  * Fixed logical and arithmetic shifts;
  * Added more Thumb instructions;
  * Fixed relative loads and stores;
  * Fixed LSL/LSR with zero shift values;
  * Fixed the disassembly of CMN.
- Verified behavior when ADD destination is the PC on real H/W.
- Rewrote the Space Firebird driver [Zsolt Vasvari]:
  * Added star field, matches with the screen shot perfectly;
  * Video timings/memory map/interrupts from schematics;
  * Added support for the color fade effect.
- Identified a couple of new opcodes in the Irem V30 CPU which improves matchit2 [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Significantly cleaned up the Spiders driver [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Changed memory system behavior so that masks can be specified independently of mirrors. By default if the mask is 0 and a mirror is present, the mask is implicitly ~mirror, just as before. But if a mask is specified, it is not limited to the non-mirrored bits. This allows you to independently control the mapping versus what is returned to the read/write handler [Aaron Giles].
- Rewrote Astrocade driver [Aaron Giles]:
  * Fully implemented all function generator modes;
  * Implemented pattern board according to schematics, including timing;
  * Fixed interrupt handling;
  * Added crosshairs to SeaWolf II;
  * Added stereo sound and panning to SeaWolf II samples;
  * Rewrote Astrocade sound emulation according to patent;
  * Sound generation now uses proper LFSR for noise effects;
  * Added partial support for Ten Pin Deluxe, including sound board emulation and internal layout.
- Fixed sound in Inferno after all these years. Sadly, it required a hack [Aaron Giles].
- Added correct video timings for the Williams games [Aaron Giles].
- Added support for misaligned PIXBLT operations in the TMS34010 core. The code still needs cleanup but improves the new JPM driver [Aaron Giles].
