---------------------------------------------------
Puzzle Time (Prototype) [Angelo Salese, Pierpaolo Prazzoli, Yoshi]

New clones added
----------------
Gals Panic S2 (Asia) [Andy Henderson]
Jansou (alt) [Uki]


Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed a paletteram entry bug in GP World [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed sprite positioning bug in Zero Target [Angelo Salese].
- Added new graphic roms to the 1999 head panic set. Also added sprite flicker flag, based on tumble pop etc [David Haywood].
- Add locations to ROM names for Mazer Blazer (and alt) roms. Add NO_DUMP entries for undumped voice roms, video prom, and pal. [Lord Nightmare].
- Preliminary proper roz effects hooked up for Zero Target [Olivier Galibert, Angelo Salese].
- Added function calls to replace the MIPS3 and PowerPC DRC's various CPU_SET_INFO bits [Aaron Giles].
- Fixed DCS2 speedup handler so it doesn't get lost during a memory remap. This should give a slight speed bump to the Seattle/Vegas games and to War Gods [Aaron Giles].
- Added service1 button tested in Dynamite Bomber (but doesn't work in game) and fixed little sprites priority problems in limenko.c [Pierpaolo Prazzoli].
- Fixed a sprite bug when flip y flag is used and cleaned-up the whole routine in Zero Target [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed sound regression in Tryout and removed deprecat.h dependancy [Angelo Salese].
- tms57002: Add two missing instructions and hack up the coef update. The real way coefficient updates are handled is a little too complex for now, but the hack throttles the update speed to the real rate given the way konami uses it (once per sync).  It's near impossible to use it in a different way anyway [Olivier Galibert].
- Fixed bug that caused 64-bit PowerPC systems to fetch opcodes in the wrong order [Aaron Giles].

- Allow chds to be directly in the ROM directory without a subdirectory [Olivier Galibert].
