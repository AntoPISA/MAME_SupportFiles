Source changes:
---------------
- Replaced kodb set with complete dump from known bootleg board (different gfx ROM layout). Added wofhfh bootleg from mame32plus. Added SF2 Magic Turbo Delta bootleg as non-working [David Haywood].
- Added skeleton hikaru driver [David Haywood, Guru].
- Fixed possible 64-bit crash/hang with survival [nuapete].
- Driver's Eyes improvements [Naibo]:
  * The communication work between CPU and 3D DSP should be limited to the master M68000, if the address mapping is done in the shared memory, master CPU would be disturbed by the slave one;
  * DIP Switches DIP3 ON for Screen on the left DIP4 ON for Screen on the right should not toggle on both;
  * The left, center and right screens have separate programs and boards, each would work independantly. About projection angles of left and right screen, the angle is correct on 'DRIVER'S EYES' title screen, however in the tracks of demo mode it doesn't seem correct;
  * The game also features a pretty nice 2D sprite layer, which still doesn't show up yet. It is known that the CPU does constantly feed the 2D video memory some meaningful and logical data.
- New driver for 'Lucky 74' (Wing Co.Ltd, 1988) [Roberto Fresca, Tomasz Slanina]:
  * Added a 2nd tilemap for background graphics;
  * Added all coinage DIP Switches;
  * Added an alternate set, but the program ROM looks like incomplete,protected or just a bad dump;

  * Emulated 2x PPI 8255 devices;
  * Finally fixed colors for background graphics;
  * Fixed colors for foreground graphics;
  * Fixed visible area to show the top of background graphics;
  * Hooked interrupts;
  * Hooked the AY8910 and therefore the NMI trigger;
  * Mapped all remaining inputs (service and player buttons);
  * Mapped the 4x DIP Switches banks;
  * Mapped the NVRAM, VRAM1-1, VRAM1-2, VRAM2-1 and VRAM2-2 properly;
  * Parent/clone relationship;
  * Promoted lucky74s to 'working' state;
  * Set the proper screen size;
  * Simplified the graphics banks;
