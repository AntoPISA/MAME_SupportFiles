Source changes:
---------------
- QT Debugger fixes [Andrew Gardner]:
  * New memory windows start focused on the active CPU.
  * Opening a utility window, closing it, and stepping no longer re-opens the window.
- shangha3.c: Added dipswitch locations to 'Shanghai III', 'Hebereke no Ponpoon' and 'Blocken' [Brian Troha].
- m6502: Seriously untested multi-dispatch-table support [O. Galibert].
- coolridr: Work around miscompile on newer versions of Clang [Phil Bennett].
- Modernized k053260 device [Andrew Gardner].
- M740 CPU family updates [R. Belmont, O. Galibert]:
  * Support for all T=1 instructions.
  * Added COM and the accumulator-only versions of INC and DEC.
- namcos2: Use the correct C68 (M37450) I/O MCU for Steel Gunner 2 [R. Belmont, Guru, Charles MacDonald].
- aristmk4.c [Heihachi73]:
  * Added Caribbean Gold (working), cleaned up comments and EPROM part numbers for a handful of games. Caribbean Gold needs some trivial input changes, as currently it has a logic door error on boot, however if you hit the coin input the error goes away and allows you to key in to perform a memory reset and finally coin up.
  * Also, 'Caribbean Gold 2' [cgold2] now has passable graphics, by using two of cgold's graphics ROMs (cgold u8 and u9 -> cgold2 u20 and u45) the game is now playable instead of a garbled mess (there are only a few tiles which differ between both games).
  * Promoted Caribbean Gold II and Fortune Hunter (and clone) to working - these had been working ever since eforest and arcwins were promoted but the flags were never removed.
- Add support for Mitsubishi M50740/50741 MCUs [R. Belmont].

- m740: Correct disassembly for seb x,A/clb x,A [R. Belmont].
- Treat x & y coordinates as 11 bit signed on dots, lines & rectangles. This fixes sprites in Zaynac X Zaynac (fc version) in MESS [smf].
- QT Debugger: The memory view chunk size radio now reports proper sizes. Fixed "ignore" command reporting incorrect invalid CPUs. Fixed crazy code responsible for opcodes' crc32s in the comments system (what was I thinking back then?) [Andrew Gardner].
- 315_5124.c: Small improvements to the palettes [Enik Land].
- i960: Add cvtilr needed by 'Zero Gunner' [R. Belmont].
- tms5220.c: Extremely minor fix for Speak External based on the 5220c and 5200 decaps, and some small documentation updates [Lord Nightmare, digshadow].
