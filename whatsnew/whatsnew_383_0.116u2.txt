Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed regressions in Gridlee and Gomoku [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Fixed some unicode build issues in the Windows code [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Updated a number of games to correctly use the SN76489 instead of the SN76496, which was a later design [Justin Kerk, Lord Nightmare].
- Cleaned up the exports from a number of drivers, adding static qualifiers to functions and variables t hat don't need to be exported and have generic sounding names [Atari Ace].
- Updated numerous drivers to remove the use of global Machine wherever possible. Also reviewed the clipping regions and made changes to ensure the passed-in cliprect was honored [Zsolt Vasvari].
- Cleaned up the Dooyong driver [Vas Crabb]:
  * Consolidated and streamlined tilemap callbacks;
  * Took better advantage of MAME's tilemap caching by building larger tilemaps so they don't need to be invalidated as often;
  * Interpreted sprite Y position as signed 9-bit value in rshark/superx (fixes some glitches);
  * Added more explanatory comments to help others reading the code.
- Changed a number of mame timer objects from void * to mame_timer * [Atari Ace].
- Fixed a couple more Irem CPU opcodes to improve Match It 2 [Robiza].
- Fixed collision detection bug in thunderX [Shimapong].
- Initial cut at working CPS3 driver. Basically works but has a lot more work to be done to finish it up [David Haywood, Andreas Naive, Tomasz Slanina, ElSemi, Philip Bennett].
- Fixed minor cycle timing issue in 6809 CPU core [Ernesto Corvi].
- Neo-Geo updates [Zsolt Vasvari]:
  * Fixed several regressions from previous update;
  * Added LED outputs;
  * Improved smaller visible area configuration.
- Fixed some incorrect information in the Neo Geo ROMsets [JohnBoy].
- Integrated platform-specific changes into the core makefile, mostly taken from the SDLMAME makefile. Changed the MAMEOS configuration variable to OSD, indicating which OSD layer is being compiled. Added a new configuration variable TARGETOS which specifies the target OS platform [Aaron Giles].
