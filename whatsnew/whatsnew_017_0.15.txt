Note: only important changes are listed.


New Clones Supported
--------------------
(frogsega) Froggers (Sega) [Nicola Salmoria]
(galmidw)  Galaxians (Midway) [Nicola Salmoria]


Source changes:
---------------
- Submitted a sound driver for Bomb Jack. The game is now a bit slow on my 486/100, -frameskip 1 is almost good but not quite [Jarek Burczynski].
- Sound support in: Amidar, Battle of Atlantis, Frogger, Lost Tomb (very nice sound, pity the ROMs are corrupted), Pooyan, Scramble, Super Cobra (note that the "scobra" ROM set is wrong - ROMs 5c, 5d and 5e must be 2k, not 4k. You can take them from one of the other two sets), The End, Time Pilot, Turtles [Nicola Salmoria].
- Added support for a version of Galaxian which is known to be original. It has Namco copyright and the code is slightly different from the other Galaxian (which has Midway copyright). I called this version (galaxian), and renamed the other (galmidw) [Nicola Salmoria].
- All these require -frameskip 1 on my 486/100. I have no idea how accurate the tempo and pitch is. If you can compare it with a real machine, please let me know what's wrong [Nicola Salmoria].
- Provided new code for -vesascan, and implemented the new "-vesaskip n" mode. It uses a 640x480 screen instead of the 800x600 used by -vesascan, and allows you to scroll the visible area using the PGUP and PGDOWN keys [Bernd Wiebelt].
- Deserves a prize for being the person who, alone, has discovered more bugs than everyone else put together. This time the bug was illegal memory acesses in games using 224x288 and 288x224 modes (Pengo, Pac Man, Rally X) [Brad Oliver].
- Carnival is finally working! [Richard Davies, Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed most of the graphics problems with Moon Patrol. The video driver is a gigantic kludge right now, but it works and at a reasonable speed (though I can't reach 60fps on my 486/100) [Nicola Salmoria].
- High score support in Pac Man, Ms. Pac Man, Crush Roller, Burger Time, Zaxxon, Congo Bongo, Pooyan, Moon Cresta, Moon Quasar [Nicola Salmoria].
- Maintaining the endless list of ROM subdirectories was getting quite boring, so I modified readroms() to make it automatically print the complete list of required ROMs if one is missing. I think I should add a CRC check as well. I also added a brief explanation of what ROMs are and why they are required - hoping this will cut down the flow of e-mail asking "gee, I run your program and it says 'unable to open file xxxx/xxxx', what should I do?" [Nicola Salmoria].
- Many people requested a way to syncronize with the video beam, to avoid jerkiness. Here it is: -vsync. It should be used together with -noscanlines, and possible -vgafreq to adjust the frame rate to be as close as possible to 60fps (use F11 to check the actual frame rate). Note that this, unlike the default timer based sync, will NOT downgrade nicely if your system is not fast enough [Nicola Salmoria].
- Miscellaneous graphics fixes to Zaxxon and Congo Bongo. Also better colors (especially in Congo Bongo) [Marc Lafontaine, Nicola Salmoria].
- Note: I discovered that the garbled sound I experienced in Scramble was caused by a bad ROM. Therefore, if sound doesn't work, check your ROM set. Note that I also changed one ROM name from "2c" to "2d" [Nicola Salmoria].
- Support for a different version of Frogger (frogsega) [Nicola Salmoria].
- I've been able to fix many bugs in the Wizard of Wor driver [Steve Scavone, Nicola Salmoria].
