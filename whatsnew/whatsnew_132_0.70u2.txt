New Game Supported
------------------
Enigma 2 [Pierpaolo Prazzoli, Tomasz Slanina] (1)

Note:
-----
(1): No Sound (bad rom?), could be merged with 8080bw?


Source changes:
----------------------
- Corrected Green Beret ROM names [Gerald].
- Fixed a few minor problems in the Wolf Pack Driver [Stefan Jokisch]
- Fixed Audit with Optional Roms [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed i86 DAA opcodes + more [Nathan Woods]
- Fixed ports in some TESTDRIVERS so there are no complaints with the Sanity Checks [smf]
- I made some tests but the changes are quite big so please test them before including. I'm sure the Y8950 will be tested by NLMSX authors too [David Haywood].
- i86 DAA fixes [David Haywood].
- In osd_fopen(), if a file is opened with mode "r", FILE_SHARE_READ will be passed to the dwShareMode parameter of CreateFile(). This allows other programs to read any files that MAME opens for read only [David Haywood].
- Inspired by Frits Hilderink (NLMSX emulator author) I attempted to:
  * Improve support of the ymdeltat module for the status registers (YM2610,YM2608,Y8950);
  * Implement x1bit/x8bit DRAM usage for the ADPCM samples;
  * Implement memory read/write via deltat (Y8950 and YM2608);
  * ADPCM synthesis in 'slave' mode (CPU l controlled, instead of memory based).
- Preliminary MCU simulation for Paddle 2 [Angelo Salese].
- Renames display_fps() to ui_display_fps() and makes it non-static [David Haywood].
- Some DIP switch / Input fixes [Curt Coder].
- Some DIP switch / Input fixes [El Condor].
- Some DIP switch fixes [Ieigo Luja].
- Various Sound Improvements to YM2610, YM2608, Y8950 [Jarek Burczynski].
