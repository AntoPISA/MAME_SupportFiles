Source changes:
---------------
- Added more accurate SSi S14001A speech chip emulation, written by one of the people at SSi who originally laid out the S14001a silicon in 1974/5! [Ed Bernard].
- nokia_3310.cpp: Started implementing the driver based on available information. Also added dumps for various models [Sandro Ronco].
- Corrections to some ROM names and labels on Elevator Action based on PCB pictures [Lord Nightmare, brizzo].
- tispeak.cpp: Dumped and added correct version of 1979 US Speak & Spell [Sean Riddle].
- vicdual: Rewrote carnival music board emulation, copy-pasted samples handling from audio/pulsar.cpp. Kept sample names and function names the same [hap].
- XAudio2 support [Brad Hughes].
- Removed this == nullptr checks and fixed most of the resulting crashes [MooglyGuy, Tafoid].
- psychic5.cpp: Added SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS [Angelo Salese].
- More configuration fixes [AJR]:
  * terrafb: remove unused NB1414M4.
  * segas16b.cpp: sanity check forgotten in last confix.
  * sega16sp.cpp: fix region width, make required (as last confix allows).
- psychic5.cpp: Fixed sprite disable for Bombs Away [Angelo Salese].
- Pass and return palette devices by reference, not as pointers [AJR]:
  * Add screen_device::has_palette();
  * Require device_gfx_interface::gfx() and palette() to access members;
  * Getters for atari_vad_device return devices as references, not pointers.
- Driver configuration fixes [AJR]:
  * Implement found() method for object finders;
  * a1200, cubo, midzeus2, etc.: remove spurious palette tags;
  * bagman, sbagman & clones: correct PROM region lengths;
  * atomicp, snapper: remove unused(?) sprite device w/no ROMs.
- taitotz: Replace HLE rendering with actual chip emulation [Ville Linde].
- NAOMI/Chihiro docs update [f205v].
- Document rest of Atomiswave registers [brizzo, MetalliC].
- Added dump of World Club Champion Football's camera sensor board [ANY].
- tourvis.cpp: Added V4.0 BIOS to the Tourvision driver [system11].
- OS/2 patch [KO Myung-Hun].
- arkanoid: Add note about the number of optical quadrature slots (24) the arkanoid 1:20 geared spinner's quadrature wheel [brizzo].
- arkanoid.cpp: Set YM2149 emulation to mix channels the same way the real PCB mixes them, by directly tying them together with no mixing resistors. This introduces some distortion, but is more accurate to actual pcb audio [Lord Nightmare].
- 40love.cpp: Added global color select bank, fixes colors in later levels for Forty-Love [Angelo Salese].
- spc1000: Cassette tape motor fixed for working properly [Miso Kim].
- arkanoid.cpp: Added emulation of the 68705 timer and timer interrupts. Fixed bugs with MCU port c ddr handling, latches and edge detection, added missing interrupt on Z80 write to MCU, and removed a boost interleave hack which was made unnecessary by these fixes. Switched the Arkanoid (older) sets to use original Taito A75 06 MCU code as opposed to the bootleg MCU code used until now. The 3 (newer) and 1 Tournament sets still use hand-hacked bootleg MCU code until original MCU chips can be dumped and/or decapped. All 9 of the dumped Arkanoid MCU code roms now work, if hooked up to the appropriate drivers. Hooked the now-working 'deprotected Taito' MCU dump up to arkanoidjbl. Added an alternate gfx ROM dumped from an original 'older' US board [Lord Nightmare, Brizzo].
- Some fast invaders improvements [ANY].
- Return std::string objects by value rather than pass by reference [AJR]:
  * strprintf is unaltered, but strformat now takes one fewer argument;
  * state_string_export still fills a buffer, but has been made const;
  * get_default_card_software now takes no arguments but returns a string.
- Some comments on TRS-01 'early radar scope' 5-PCB set. Fixed some ROM names based on PCB pictures from Superully [Lord Nightmare].
- segas18.cpp: Add documentation of a Laser Ghost test PCB [Arzeno Fabrice].
- meadwttl.cpp: ROM labels update for Bombs Away (Meadows) [Stiletto, Andrew Welburn].
- Common osd path environment var expansion [Jeffrey Clark].
- Add LUA console support back in [Jeffrey Clark].
- pc9801_86: Add PCM [Carl].
- Added official updater roms to the calspeeda set so that you can update the HDD/game revision if you so please [mrsinister].
- ts803: Can display text and graphics, can boot from disk [Gabriele D'Antona].
- dccons.c: Dreamcast v1.022 "no MIL-CD" BIOS dumped [Leonard Oliveira]. Katana Set5 Dev.Box BIOS v1.001 found. Sorted out bioses/flashes, removed outdated comments [MetalliC].
- apple2e: Fix $c800 arbitration, fixes IDE and SCSI cards among others [R. Belmont].
- rR9751: Clean up, add timer register, and add another system disk set to software list [Brandon Munger].
- makedep.py: Finish making it python3-compatible [Olivier Galibert].
- sfkick.cpp: Fill in missing DIP switches and added DIP locations [Brian Troha].
- Added pre-compiled headers support to build system [Miodrag Milanović].
- Improvements to hp9845b driver [F. Ulivi].
- Increase debug console maximum parameters in debugcon.h [ConHuevosGuey].

- fidelz80: Redumped CC10B PRG ROM [Berger].
- rf5c400: Added external memory r/w function [Ville Linde].
- marywu: Most of the hardware has been mapped by analysing the PCB tracks. This set of commits include: a video layout with all 30 LEDs 13 double-digit 7seg modules an improved memory map hooking up the couple AY8910-3 chips, 2kb of Static RAM and the keyboard/display controller (an i8279 clone) multiplexing signals for the 7seg displays LEDs being controlled by the IO ports of the 2 AY8910-3 chips 8-bit set of DIP-Switches, a 2x16 keyboard and 4 push buttons mapped to the i8279 scanlines and return lines [Felipe Sanches].
- Some more validity checking improvements [AJR]:
  * The -validate command now accepts an optional string, validating only matching drivers. This has proven useful for debugging. The default is to validate all drivers as usual;
  * Devices' names are tracked when validating their auto-finders.
- Have sound_stream::input_name return the std::string it constructs [AJR].
- Added SteamLink initial support [Sam Lantiga, Miodrag Milanović].
- Refactored NTSC pass and added sliders [ImJezze]:
  * Merged YIQ encode and decode pass into one NTSC pass;
  * Fixed half texel offset;
  * Re-added usage of A value;
  * Re-added usage of P value;
  * Re-added jitter of B value;
  * Changed default O value to 0;
  * Reduced sample count to 64;
  * Removed duplicate YIQ settings definition;
  * Added sliders for most NTSC settings;
  * Fit B value jitter between a min/max range of 0 and 1;
  * Fit A and B value between a min/max range of -1 and 1.
  * Refactored color convergence pass:
  - Color convergence is now independent from ratio;
  - Color convergence is now limited to a maximum of 10;
  - The radial color convergence now "translates" the most outer pixel as they would be translated by the linear color convergence with the same amount;
  - Added color convergence pass to vector rendering.
  * Misc:
  - Fixed half texel offset in pre-scale pass;
  - Fit scan-line jitter between a min/max range of 0 and 1;
  - Color convolution, defocus and phosphor pass will now be skipped if all influencing parameters are 0;
  - Added hum bar simulation based on [MooglyGuy's] GLSL port of the MAME shader pipeline;
  - Added monochrome-chessboard.png;
  - Added slot-mask-aligned.png (to simulate a TFT LCD).
