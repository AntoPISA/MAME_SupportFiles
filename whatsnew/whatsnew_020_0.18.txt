Program changes
---------------
- Added support for the original, Universal version of Mr. Do!. I renamed the other, which has an additional Taito copyright notice, "mrdot" [Nicola Salmoria].
- Bomb Jack is much faster on a 486. Now runs very well with -frameskip 1 on my 486/100 [Nicola Salmoria].
- Submitted a much faster version of the 8086 emulation. Q*Bert now runs at full speed with -frameskip 1 on my 486/100 [Fabrice Frances].
- Fixed bug in the 8910 emulation which caused noise to be played in Crazy Kong when you jumped over a barrel [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed bugs in Jump Bug and Bagman sound drivers which caused page faults when run under DOS [Nicola Salmoria].
- Green Beret [Nicola Salmoria]:
  * The speed should now be VERY accurate. It also syncs correctly with the music.
  * Sound pitch should be correct as well (though it changes after you die for the first time...)
  * High score support.
  * Fixed sprite clipping problem on the left of the screen.
  * Fixed memory trashing bug in dirtybuffer handling.
- High score support in Space Invaders (Invaders only - not clones) [Nicola Salmoria].
- I also added the same lousy noise to Galaxian, Pisces, Moon Cresta, Moon Quasar [Nicola Salmoria].
- I finally added some lousy, very inaccurate, noise to the 76496 emulator. This affects Lady Bug and Green Beret [Nicola Salmoria].
- Fixed some problems in the Venture driver, and provided drivers for Mouse Trap and Pepper II, which run on similar hardware (Pepper II is not complete yet). Note that the required Venture ROM set has changed - the other one was missing one ROM. Collision detection doesn't work - in Mouse Trap, you can use keys 7 and 8 to simulate a sprite-to-character and a sprite-to-sprite collision [Marc Lafontaine].
- Provided a Space Panic driver [Mike Coates].
- Preliminary support for Jungle King / Jungle Hunt. Slow but playable. I haven't the gfx bank selector, therefore you'll have to pick the correct background graphics yourself. Use keys C and V to change it [Nicola Salmoria].
- Preliminary support for Seicross, using the Crazy Kong driver. Not playable [Nicola Salmoria].
- Rotated the controls for Q*Bert [Nicola Salmoria].
- Some changes to music tempo in Amidar, Pooyan, Time Pilot [Nicola Salmoria].
- Sprite placement in Pac Man, Ms Pac Man and Crush Roller should now be arcade perfect. Thanks to Richard Davies who verified it on a real machine [Nicola Salmoria].
- Support for a version of Crazy Kong running on Scramble hardware [Nicola Salmoria].
- VERY preliminary support for Elevator Action. Not playable [Nicola Salmoria].
- Zaxxon and Congo Bongo now save their high scores for real. The code had disappeared from the drivers... I _did_ write it, since I had .hi files in my directories ;-) [Nicola Salmoria].


Source changes:
---------------
- Samples are now loadaed by the main engine, not the single drivers. This is done via the new field samplenames in the GameDriver structure. Samples can then be retrieved by the drivers in Machine->samples.
