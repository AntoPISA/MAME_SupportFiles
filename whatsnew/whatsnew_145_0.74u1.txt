Source changes:
---------------
- Added "(Medal) Yumefuda" as TestDriver. Preliminary, doesn't boot yet [Angelo Salese].
- Added "Competition Golf" as TestDriver. Incomplete video emulation [Angelo Salese].
- Added Paddle support to "Pop 'n' bounce" (use -mouse, enable it in test mode, the default is joystick not paddle) [David Haywood].
- Changed frogs to use a 3 way joystick instead of a 3 way joystick and 2 buttons which was incorrect [Robin Merrill].
- Fixed Crash with the original mustang set [R. Belmont].
- Fixed SegaPCM bug [Olivier Galibert].
- Fixed some problems with defaults in inptport.c [Robin Merrill].
- Further ST-V improvements [Angelo Salese, David Haywood].
- Hopefully fixed crash some people were having with Nostradamus [David Haywood].
- Improved the type 1 GX games a bit but none are working well enough to enable yet [R. Belmont].
- MAME now recognises off-screen shots with the Act-Labs gun in a way which works better with certain drivers (Area 51 etc,) [Bryan McPhail].
- Moved Some Config Code around [Nathan Woods].
- Remapped some of the mid*unit.c buttons to match the real board inputs.
- Various SH2 fixes improving Master/Slave support (this improves shienryu on st-v but its not yet playable due to incomplete st-v emulation) [Olivier Galibert].
