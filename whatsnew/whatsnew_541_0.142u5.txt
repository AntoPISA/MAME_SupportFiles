Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed Final Arch failing the IC13 test [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed Final Arch and Sando-R multi cart support [Angelo Salese].
- Internal HLSL cleanup - removed aux texcoords, restored software vertex processing due to low-end cards not doing hardware vertex processing, removed unnecessary tristrip->trilist splitting. Restores D3D functionality on integrated chipsets and marginal cards [Ryan Holtz, Ashura-X].
- Dumped GFX/sound ROMs to Gigaman 2 [f205v, Smitdogg, The Dumping Union].
- Converted PlayStation GPU to a device [smf].
- Added PORT_NAME to buttons to better illustrate actual use in Atari System 1 and Atari G1 drivers [Tafoid].
- inptport.c: Keyboard chars initialization fix [Tom Clayton].
- konicdev et al.: Turn the 053250 into a modern device [Oliver Galibert].
- More accurate pixel clocks for Sega Saturn/ST-V [Angelo Salese].
- Moved SCSP to main IRQ function into an external write line function, fixes sound regression in Groove on Fight and Intro Don Don [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed an ST-V window effect bug when it's in double interlace mode, fixes a graphic bug with Virtua Mahjong [Angelo Salese].
- Fixed Sega Saturn/ST-V start-up crash that was happening on some ends [Oliver Stoneberg].
- Fixed a use-after-free bug in build/verinfo.c [Oliver Stoneberg].
- megatech.c: Added some verified labels [ElBarto].
- PlayStation GPU splits 4 point polygons into triangles [smf].
- Documentation update for Naomi [f205v].
- Fixed MC6845 related crash on 4roses and 4rosesa [Roberto Fresca].
- tms52xx: Minor updates to the comments and the disabled-by-default pulse excitation code to better match how hardware would probably work [Lord Nightmare, Neill Corlett].
- HLSL Updates [Ryan Holtz, Bat Country Entertainment]:
  * Switched to point-sampling through most of the shader chain to avoid non-intentional pixel smearing.
  * Corrected alignment and scaling on the shadow mask and scanlines; dramatically reduces rainbow banding at non-oversampled resolutions .
- Fixed a rather silly bug with SCU DSP execute flag [Angelo Salese].
- Moved SMPC intback command inside a timer, removes a kludge for SMPC mask IRQ [Angelo Salese].
- Changed name of sn76489 variant used in Sega Master System and Megadrive/Genesis from SMSIII to the more technically accurate SEGAPSG, as the PSG in question was not only used on the mark 3 units [Lord Nightmare].
- Added accurate hblank durations to Sega Saturn/ST-V HW [Angelo Salese, Corrado Tomaselli, Charles MacDonald].
- ertictac/poizone: Greatly improved (not perfect) audio [R. Belmont, Heihachi_73].
- Switch SEGA System E to use the SEGAPSG sn764xx variant, as it uses two SEGA 315-5124 VDPs which have the SEGAPSG integrated. Should slightly improve sound [Lord Nightmare].
- Fixed Sega System E to use xtal.h, fixed mc8123 comment, clarified PCB diagram, verified xtal for z80b [Lord Nightmare, Charles MacDonald].
- i286: Enabling 287 emulation by trapping when needed [Carl].
- idectrl: Clears error status on driver initialization [Carl].
- Added HD6345 CRTC-II variant to mc6845.c [Curt Coder].
- idectrl: Implemented verify no retry command [Carl] .
- i86: Fixed imul instruction [Carl].
- Low-level input upgrade. Classes now exist for input_codes, input_items, input_devices, and input_seqs. Also created an input_manager class to hold machine-global state and made it accessible via machine.input(). Expanded the device index range (0-255, up from 0-16), and the OSD can now specify the device index explicitly if they can better keep the indexes from varying run-to-run [Aaron Giles].
- HLSL Updates [Ryan Holtz, Bat Country Entertainment, austere, SoltanGris42]:
  * Added the ability to render screenshots at arbitrary resolutions.
  * Added the ability to record AVI videos (albeit with no audio) at arbitrary resolutions.
  * Added a 43-tap-wide FIR-based NTSC filter with tunable Y, I and Q frequency response.
  * Updated scanlines to have a user-tunable pixel-height ratio in addition to the current screen-height ratio.
- Fixed a VRAM leak that was causing many dynamic-resolution drivers to run out of memory mid-run [Aaron Giles].
- Implemented IRQ callbacks for the mc146818 RTC [Carl].
- Fixed UNSP CPU core reset [Robbbert].
- Fixed POP, POPF, PUSHF, and flags for V20 core [Carl, Alex Jackson].
- memory [Oliver Galibert]:
  * Store legacy object and handler together in the same structure.
  * Pass the legacy object/handler as a set_delegate parameter.
  * Merge width-conversion functions together from the same source width.
  * Build a structure with all possible delegate sizes.
  * Separate delegates for the main access and the subaccesses.
  * Split the subaccesses delegation information per-slot.
  * Make the memdump file include a description of every subunit
  * Add utility methods to clean up colliding subunit masks and testing if any are remaining.
  * Combine the map_range and handler_read/write() operations into one.
  * Proxy the handler entry access when adding handlers.
  * Tuck the unitmask into the proxy.
  * Split the map_range function into a fixed entry mapping one and a dynamically allocating entry one.
  * Make the proxy manage a list of handlers instead of a unique one.
  * Add a handler copy function which works on subunits-only handlers.
  * Finally allow different handlers on different subunits of the same address.
  * Implement depopulate_unused().
  * Change the gc into a refcounter, for speed reasons.
- pic8259: Fixed edge triggering and non-specific EOI [Carl, Miodrag Milanovic].
- Added SKIT_F0 opcode to the uPD7801/uPD7810 CPU core [Angelo Salese].
- Split HLSL code into a separate file, d3dhlsl.c/.h. Also split drawd3d.c into a couple of headers [Ryan Holtz, Bat Country Entertainment].
- nec disassembler: Only display "byte/word ptr" when it's actually needed to resolve ambiguity (same as the i386 disassembler) [Alex Jackson].
- Add ROM dump from motor drive board for Sega Touring Car Championship [RetroRepair].
- Hooked up the 2 PPI8255 for Super Crowns Golf [Angelo Salese].

- i86: Fix initial CS on reset [Alex Jackson].
- Fix inverted check on anonymous timers prior to saving state. Also fix bug where we fail to ignore the permanent non-expiring anonymous timer. Added code to log timers, and we now log them at each save attempt as well as at restore time. Should fix most recent save state releated regressions [Aaron Giles].
- Started to work on Neogeo ROM naming, mostly removal of .bin extension in favour of chiplabel.socketlabel convention [Johnboy].
- Added echo emulation to the OkiM6376 sound chip [J. Wallace].
