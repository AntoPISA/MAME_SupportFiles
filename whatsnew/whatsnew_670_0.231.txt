Sonic Blast Man 2 Special Turbo (SNES bootleg, set 2) [ShouTime]

-rf5c68: update stream before writing to wave RAM [hap]

-New BSD-licensed OPL/OPLL (YM3526, YM3812, YM2413, Y8950, YMF262, etc) cores (#7869) [Aaron Giles]
 * OPL prep. Define FAMILY constant in register classes, and use that instead of template specialization for family-specific
    behaviors. Expand channel masks to 32 bits. Add is_keyon() helper.
 * Made FM channel and operator mapping more flexible. Operators are now owned by the engine and can be dynamically assigned to
    channels. Register classes now provide a mapping between a linear set of operators and channels. The register data array is now
    a regular array instead of a vector.
 * Minor change for consistency.
 * Introduce OPL registers and create a ymopl_engine. Add support for sustain-less notes and the OPL envelope clocks (which does not
    divide by 3).
 * Moved keycode calculations into register class. Removed unnecessary recalc in phase generator. Lined up OPL frequency, feedback,
    algorithm, and total level.
 * Implement key scale level and OPL-specific LFO and phase handling.
 * Create new YM3526 device based on new OPL. Fix keyon and sustain behaviors.
 * Fix weird OPL multiple values. Clean up and further document OPL LFO.
 * No busy flag on OPL, so no need to do the work. Add a right shift of 1 to the output stage to line up volume with old
    implementation.
 * More compact way of representing key scale level values.
 * Move the KSL bitswap into the registers since it's apparently fixed in OPLL and perhaps others.
 * Add support for ryhthm generation in OPL. Change compute_volume to take a phase value directly, and expose operator phase.
 * Fix OPL timers.
 * Start LFSR with a non-zero value to ensure it actually starts generating for OPL.
 * Fix silly bug in sustain logic for OPL. Fixes a lot of previously missing sounds.
 * Create OPL2 engine. Add waveform support for OPL2/3 waveforms.
 * Wire up YM3812 to the new OPL2 engine.
 * Reset OPL timers when the mask is written as well.
 * Manage rhythm key ons separately. Fixes Wardner awfulness.
 * Explicitly make channel logic handle 0, 2, or 4 operators rather than checking each one for null. Also simplify the combining
    logic for the 2 operator case.
 * Reverse bit order of LFSRs to make things a little simpler. Fix OPL LFSR so that it has its full 23-bit period.
 * Change outputs along the path to arrays rather than stereo items. This allows for four channel output. Also add a constant for
    the number of outputs to the register class.
 * Move status register bit definitions to the registers class. Generically support the IRQ bit.
 * Create shared helpers for FP encode/decode/roundtrip and use them throughout. Also update TMNT to use the FP decoder.
 * No need to clamp when using the roundtrip.
 * Clear the EOS flag when execute is turned off on ADPCM-B. Fix combine_status in YM2608 to ignore previously set flags.
 * Add missing note_select in base class. Don't add 1 to the OPL release rate.
 * Move Y8950 over to new OPL engine.
 * Remove old y8950, along with fmopl and ymdeltat
 * Add updates prior to status reads for ADPCM systems.
 * Add status_mask and irq_reset logic into the core. Clean up documentation on family-specific registers. Includes some temporary
    gross debugging stuff.
 * Made debugging less gross by giving operators and channels a reference back to their owner.
 * Fix status port address in OPL chips. Reduce ADPCM volume to match previous implementation.
 * Fix Y8950 ADPCM start. Return masked status properly.
 * Initial cut at OPLL mapping.
 * Add YM2413 support based on ymfm; renamed vrc7snd to ds1001; added YM2423 amd YMF281 variants as well. Instrument data is now
    loaded via external ROMs. Added 'depress' envelope support to the core engine. Fixed a number of issues in the ymopll_engine.
    Documented hard-coded values. Moved register clear into register-specific reset.
 * Add missing identifier.
 * Y8950 is OPL not OPL2.
 * Some documentation cleanup. Consistency fixes in the register classes.
 * Consolidate large comments. Add support for delayed modulators for OPL. Broke out 2-op and 4-op cases to help simplify logic.
    Fixed overflow handling in fp encoding.
 * Fix silly bug.
 * Changed operator assignment mechanism to be more readable. Added prepare method to be called at the start of sound update. Added
    ALL_CHANNELS constant to register files. Updated all consumers to call prepare and use constants where applicable.
 * Move YMF262 and YMF278B to use new FM engine for OPL3/4. Fix several issues in OPL3 logic, which now seems to work ok.
 * Minor fixes. More documentation.
 * Fix MSVC build.
 * Add caching of data to prepare methods to improve performance. Moved non-register decoding logic out of the .h file and into .cpp
    file. Move phase_step calculation into register class.
 * More notes. Removed keycode from cache. Split 2/4-operator outputs into separate functions. Changed OPN/OPL to use templates for
    variants. Added channel/operator_offset helpers.
 * Fairly substantial overhaul of register interface. Register interface is now stateless and contains family-specific state.
    Channel and operator accessors are prefixed by ch_/op_ now and require an offset to the specific channel or operator. Moved
    LFO/noise generation into register class, along with keyon logging.
 * Add noise back to OPL/OPLL
 * Added early-out for low envelope. Moved waveform logic out into family-specific code. General clean up of ordering. Reduced
    family base class to minimal needed.
 * More aggressively track active channels to help performance.
 * Use only summing outputs for consideration of active channels. Centralize the logic of determined 4-op vs 2-op.
 * More conservative channel deactivation.
 * Add helper to compute the sample rate and use it in all implementations. Remove unneeded chnum/opnum members.
 * Fix error in YM2612 that caused crashes.
 * Switching parameters and locals to 32-bit values gives a noticeable performance boost. Checkpoint 1.
 * More moving to 32-bit values. Checkpoint 2.
 * Last of the 32-bit promotions.
 * Ensure SSG inverted flag is only tested on systems with SSG support in the innermost loops.
 * Make most constants 32-bit as well. Expose some constants via the engine class.
 * Expand waveforms ahead of time. Optimize the attenuation lookup a bit.
 * If volume is low, don't erase output, just leave it alone. Fixes missing sound in raimais.
 * Replace a couple of magic numbers with constants.
 * Normalization of FM engine usage across consumers.
 * Removed explicit external prepare() call; this logic is now automatically done after writes and periodically. Changed OPL/OPLL to
    use native formats for block/fnum. Fixed waveform generation. Fixed PM and AM depth on OPL/OPLL.
 * Cache multiple value. Clean up output handling a bit.
 * Move multiple caching ahead of phase step caching.
 * Fully split OPLL from OPL. Remove many hacks now that OPLL registers can have state. Created shared helpers between OPL/OPLL.
    Removed more aggressive channel disables since it was not rhythm friendly and didn't really buy much.
 * Remove old comment
 * Remove bad write in OPL mode case. Fixes fsoccer intro. Only call set_reset_status() once per mode call.
 * Remove FM output boost in YM2608/2610. Not sure why I did that. Better matches previous volume now.
 * Make AM/PM logging less confusing.
 * Let's actually set DYNAMIC_OPS properly, eh?
 * Improved logging.
 * Comment cleanups. Add constant for dynamic phase. Pre-shift sustain level. Srcclean.
 * Fix memory regions on YM2608 games.
 * Clean up ymadpcm to line up with recent ymfm changes.
 * y8950: Reshuffle read/write handlers. Rename them to less confusing names.
 * ym2413: Reshuffle read/write handlers. Rename them to less confusing names.
 * ym3526/ym3812: Reshuffle read/write handlers. Rename them to less confusing names.
 * ymf262: Match read/write details to datasheet and previous tests.
 * Use a constexpr function instead of macro for packing operator numbers. Pre-compute OPM LFO waveforms.
 * Generate OPL4 engine to support the proper clock divider and new flags. Update YMF278B to use FM timers and status rather than
    replicating the logic.
 * Fix 4-operator enable on new OPL4 instance.
 * Fix FM downsampling and adjust balance in YM278B.

 * Fixed various sound issues in Mighty Guy so that it sounds almost exactly like PCB.
   - Fixed BGM tempo was unstable. The frequency setting of DAC and timer clock are now linked. When changes the DAC clock, Sound
      driver set wait loop count ($C010) in the range of 2 to 4 in order to keep the tempo of BGM even if changed clock. This was
      the cause of the slow BGM in previous versions.
   - Fixed DAC clock calculation. I changed this so that sound plays same as PCB.
   - Implemented a protect command 0x11 to stop the DAC. This is needed to stop DAC sound when the psycho gun is stopped.
