Source changes:
---------------
- srcclean now processes XML & C comments the same, so they can be indented but within the comment itself spaces are used [smf].
- Remove extraneous line continuation characters followed by a blank line and blank lines that follow an opening brace in c files [smf].
- i8244.c: Added a device implementation for the i8244/i8245 [Wilbert Pol].
- diimage: Allow image devices to skip core fopen() of the image's filename and handle themselves in call_load() [R. Belmont].
- uimain.c: use slot interface names for filling current values in slot menu, because using command line options produces garbage at least on OS10.6.8 [Fabio Priuli].
- subsino.c: Hopper emulation in stisub, smoto and clones [Luca Elia].
- DSP16: Additional opcodes & disassembly fixes [Andrew Gardner].
- n68681: Fixed trashing of the serial parameters when ACR is updated [R. Belmont].
- MIDI core updates [R. Belmont]:
  * Add MIDI in and out ports as image device types.
  * Add OSD calls to check for and read MIDI input.
  * Add MIDI in image device which reads input and converts it to a serial bitstream.
- d3dhlsl.c: Made HLSL switchable at runtime, Ctrl+Alt+F5 [MooglyGuy].
- MIDI: Allow input port to work without a connected real device [R. Belmont].
- First pass on MIDI out support [R. Belmont].
- DSP16: Additional opcodes [Andrew Gardner].
- Hooked up lamps in 'Virtua Racing' [SailorSat].
- Added a preliminary boolean flag to MC6845 interface structure: "show border area". If true, it will show the whole video area including border + blanking areas [Angelo Salese].
- DSP16: The PC moves on from potentially all used opcodes now [Andrew Gardner].
- MIDI: Fixed several bugs and bumped the input buffer sizes [R. Belmont].
- Lucky'74 (set 2): Proper inputs to reflect the real payrate table [Roberto Fresca]..
- QT Debugger improvements [Andrew Gardner]:
  * Fixed disassembly window not following PC correctly.
  * Switched font to Courier New since it seems more universal.
  * Fixed gaps between rendered text characters.
  * Plumbed mouse handling through the debugger core (clicking selects).
  * Made the Enter key behave like old SDL debugger; silently steps.
- wwfsstar.c: Correct ROM loads for genuine PCBs sets and correct a few ROM labels. Added the bootleg set and documentation about it [Brian Troha] 
- wwfsstarj: Correct program / tx tile roms [Stevebm1, Porchy].
- qix.c: Resolve device references at initialisation where possible [Phil Bennett].
- sharcdsm.c [Pavel Semerad]:
  * Added omitted direction flags in instruction using both PM() and DM().
  * In instruction with 6bit immediate data, this data is signed value. It would be better to show this sign because it is confusing to see for example 0x3F which actually means -1 (32bit immed data are not confusing as that big values are easy to recognize).
- Bonne Chance!: Worked complete inputs from the scratch. Promoted to working. Added some notes [Roberto Fresca]..
- Bonne Chance!: Added proper palette. Now the game seems to get accurate colors. Also added some descriptive notes and instructions for the service mode [Roberto Fresca].
- Added many PAL10L8's for balsente.c games [Kevin Eshbach].
- Modernised the R3000 core [Phil Bennett]:
  * The following variants are supported: R3041, R3051, R3052, R3071 and R3081.
  * Endianness is now specified by MCFG_R3000_ENDIANNESS() (default is big-endian).
  * Removed configuration struct. Cache sizes and FPU availability are now determined from the CPU type.
  * Added state saving.
  * Added BrCond input callbacks.
- CPS-2 update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Fixed 3 labels in sfa2u.
  * Reordered sfz2alj set.
- PSX: Change the rendering back to quads as less people complained about the old graphical issues compares to the new ones [smf].
- segas16a.c: Correctly redumped the 317-5021 FD1089B for 'Sukeban Jansi Ryuko' [hotgraphics, Song Gao, Bad A Billy, ranger_lennier, Yohji, Smitdogg, Charles MacDonald, The Dumping Union].
- PSX: Uses a devcb2 for cpu to cd controller communication, the address decoding is internal to the cpu & the cd controller is on it's own 8 bit bus [smf].
- m740: Correct disassembly for bit+zp+rel. offset form of BBC/BBS [R. Belmont].
- PSX: Use devcb2 for cpu to spu hookup as it's on it's own 16 bit bus. Removed the spu hookup in taitogn at 0x1fa51c00 as it doesn't make sense, will wait for bug reports before investigating further [smf].
- d3dhlsl.c: Add preliminary vector post-processing [MooglyGuy].

- ZN update [Team CPS-1]:
  * Confirmed 1 label in sfexu.
  * Added a note in sfexa set.

  * Save and load window locations.

  * Fixed color when cursor is the same as PC in debug view.
  * Closing the main window now shuts down the machine (same as quit).
