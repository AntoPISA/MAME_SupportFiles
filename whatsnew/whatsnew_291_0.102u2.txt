Source changes:
---------------
- Fixed 16-bit i386 disassembly so it stays within the current segment [Nathan Woods].
- Fixed several uninitialized variables, incorrect string compares, and inconsistent variable declarations found by the VC compiler [Oshah].
- Properly hooked up tape samples in 'Thief', 'NATO Defense', and 'Shark Attack' now that sample pausing is available [Bart Tobalske].
- Rewrote the Voodoo emulation code to be more accurate to the original [Aaron Giles]:
  * Support for multiple simultaneous boards (hello 'Silent Scope').
  * Pixel-pipelined framebuffer accesses now work.
  * Alpha buffer operations now supported.
  * Triple buffering now supported.
  * Proper memory allocation and handling based on configuration.
  * Proper FIFO handling, including low/high water marks and stalling.
  * Approximate timing calculations based on quoted fill rate specs.
  * Detail textures implemented.
  * All math is done in fixed point.
  * Proper edges calculated for polygons (stars appear in 'Gradius 4' now).
  * Much easier to add specific rasterizers now.
  This is a work in progress; some stuff is not quite right yet. Voodoo 2 emulation is completely broken.
- Some minor cleanups to the System 32 driver. 'Air Rescue' and 'F1 Exhaust Note' now share common multi-PCB faking logic [anonymous].
- Some minor 'Turbo Sub' changes [Philip Bennett]:
  * Added some more notes.
  * Corrected some hardware functions in accordance with the schematics.
- Tweaked the 68000 disassembler to display F-line traps in a more obvious fashion. Also changed to decorate jump targets for relative branches [Alex Jackson].
