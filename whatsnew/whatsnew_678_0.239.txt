    device is removed prior to loading.  These entries have been updated in the same manner as gberet.
 * I also found apba also works regardless of whether the c1541 slot device is removed or not so this has also been promoted to
    working status.  In addition, whilst testing apba, I found that the game asks for Side 2 not Side B so I have corrected the side
    numbering for apb and apba.

    correctly hooked up on the driver.

-screen: report refresh rate <1hz as error in validity check [hap]

-Moved localised I/O port name lookup into I/O port manager [Vas Crabb].
 * Added pseudo format specifiers to controller port names: %p for player and %% for literal percent symbol.  This lets you get the
    localised player identifier in overridden input names (see NES and Neo-Geo for examples), and reduces the number of messages to
    translate.
 * For translators, the new messages are mostly previously existing messages with wording adjusted for clarity (e.g. referring to
    "media" rather than "ROMs" in several places, as things like disk and tape images are included).  It's also possible to localise
    the "???" dipslayed for an input without a valid name, but that should never actually appear in practice.

Elektronika IM-01 [Radon17]

-bus/nes_ctrl: Disentangled Famicom joypad 2 from expansion port code (#8949) [kmg]
 * Removed read_exp call from fcpad2. The FC expansion port is not tied to the relevant line at all.
 * Replaced with read_bit2 in the control port interface for the same purpose.
 * Separated JOYPAD inputs from MIC. The microphone shouldn't be mixed with button inputs' shift register.
   - machine/nes.cpp: Also removed read_exp calls on FC control ports. Other than the microphone on fcpad2 nothing used these (nor
      should they as the only line in common is $4017 bit 0, which in general is never used by the expansion port).

-spinb/inder.cpp: WIP. Moved metalman from inder to spinb [Robbbert].

-mame.lst: moved metalman to its new position [Robbbert]

-emu/mconfig.cpp: Made checks on device add/replace stricter [Vas Crabb].

-bus/nes_ctrl: Work on Famicom joypads + more separation of EXP port (#8956) [kmg]
 * bus/nes_ctrl: Work on Famicom joypads + more separation of EXP port.
   - Enforced proper strobe behavior on joypads. Added helper function to controller interface for common pattern.
   - Added proper expansion port version of joypad.
   - Streamlined pachinko controller by making it an expansion joypad subclass. Moreover, ball launch lever now works correctly!
   - Added missing battery-backed WRAM to Pachio-kun 5, game runs now.
   - Simplified arcade stick a bit, now also a subclass of the expansion joypad.
   - Rewrote Hori Twin and 4 Players adapters. The latter's 4P mode protocol now works. In theory this supports six players
      simultaneously, though all known games using it have duplicate controls for P1 and P2.
     * machine/nes.cpp: Removed hack that shifted bit 0 reads to support controller port joypads on expansion port. There shouldn't
        be any expansion port devices left that write to bit 0.
 * Fix missing battery-backed WRAM for Royal Blood and Vegas Connection, while we're at it.
