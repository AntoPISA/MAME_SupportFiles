These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Fixed the internal orientation of the Cinematronics games, if you use artwork files for those games you'll have tomanually flip them (or redownload) [Nicola Salmoria].
- Sprite multiplexing support in the Exidy440 games, this fixes Chiller's start screen [Aaron Giles].


Source changes:
---------------
- Improved Capcom Avengers, the wrong colors are caused by the protection [Phil Stroffolino].
- Added noise generator to the Namco sound emulation [Takahiro Nogi].
- Added OSD_FILETYPE_NVRAM [Nicola Salmoria].
- MachineDriver->frames_per_second is now a float [Nicola Salmoria].
- Removed *hiscore_load and *hiscore_save from the GameDriver structure. To manage nvram/eeprom/cmos/etc the new *nvram_handler in struct MachineDriver must be used. High score save is temporarily disabled. It will be added again in a future release using an external .dat file [Nicola Salmoria].
- Removed *rom_decode and *opcode_decode from struct GameDriver. Decryption must now be handled by *driver_init. If opcodes and data are decrypted separately, remember to allocate a larger chunk of memory in the ROM declaration, decode the opcodes there, and call memory_set_opcode_base() to tell the memory system where the opcodes are. Note that this new system allows bank switching with encrypted ROMs, which wasn't possible before [Nicola Salmoria].
- The struct GameDriver reorganization is finally complete. Drivers should now use the GAME() and GAMEX() macros and not directly the GameDriver structure. IMPORTANT FOR PORTERS: Note that the clone_of field now is not necessarily 0 even if the game is not a clone. If clone_of is not 0, to know if the game is a clone you have to check (clone_of->flags & NOT_A_DRIVER) is 0 [Nicola Salmoria].
